Resident Indian citizens who were abroad from November 9 to December 30 can avail this facility up to March 31, 2017 and NRI citizens, who were abroad during this period, can exchange their defunct notes up to June 30, 2017, RBI said in a late evening statement.

""While there is no monetary limit for exchange for the eligible resident Indians, the limit for NRIs will be as per the relevant FEMA Regulations (Rs 25,000 per person),"" it said.

Citizens can avail this facility in their individual capacity once during the period on submission of ID documents, and on submission of documentary evidence showing they were abroad during the period and that they have not availed the exchange facility earlier, the RBI said.

The statement added that no third party tender will be accepted under the facility.

On fulfilment of the terms and conditions and the genuineness of the notes tendered, it said, adding admissible amount will be credited to the tenderer's KYC compliant bank account.

This facility will be available through Reserve Bank offices at Mumbai, New Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata and Nagpur.

According to RBI, Indian citizens resident in Nepal, Bhutan, Pakistan and Bangladesh cannot avail this facility.

""Any person, aggrieved by the decision of the Reserve Bank may prefer an appeal to the Central Board of the Reserve Bank within 14 days of the communication of such refusal to him,"" it said.

Such representations may be addressed to the Central Board, Reserve Bank of India, Secretary's Department, it added."
"JAN 01 2017, 10:23 IST",Business,"New Delhi, Jan 1, 2016, PTI,",Govt mulls 10 paise cess to provide social safety to coolies,"Railway coolies -- roughly 20,000 -- may soon be part of the social safety net as the government is weighing a cess of 10 paise on every rail ticket to bring them under the ambit of schemes run by retirement fund body EPFO.

This will be part of the government's overall efforts to bring over 40 crore unorganised sector workers under the social security net of the Employees' Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO).

A back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that this will help mobilise about Rs 4.38 crore every year, which will be enough to provide basic minimum facilities like PF, pension and group insurance to coolies.

Indian Railways issues 10-12 lakh rail travel tickets everyday, including 58 per cent reserved tickets. Thus, the move can help mop up about Rs 1.2 lakh every day for the purpose.

Chairman of the Central Board of Trustees, EPFO's apex decision-making body, Labour Minister Bandaru Dattatreya assured the members to look into the proposal mooted by employee representative Ashok Singh.

Singh, the Vice-President of Indian National Trade Union Congress, had floated the proposal at the CBT meeting in Bengaluru on December 19.

A senior ministry official said, ""The labour ministry will soon take up the proposal with Indian Railways and the finance ministry for levying the cess, which will be a negligible amount for passengers, but would help bring these 20,000 workers under the social security net of EPFO.""

The official is hopeful that the cess could be announced in the forthcoming general budget, which is likely to be tabled in Parliament on February 1, 2017.

The proposed cess of 10 paise is on every ticket sold by Indian Railways. It will not be levied per passenger. One ticket sold by Indian Railways can have multiple passengers."
"JAN 01 2017, 14:54 IST",Business,"New Delhi, Jan 1, 2017 (PTI),",New Year bonanza: Jobs mkt eyes 8.75 L hiring in formal sector,"The New Year is expected to bring good news for job seekers with the country's organised sector set to generate about 8.75 lakh new jobs, though the average salary hike is likely to be in single digit, say experts.

The hiring outlook for India got a significant blow post- demonetisation and segments like real estate, construction, infrastructure and high-end automobiles are expected to be impacted in the longer term, experts said but will eventually benefit by creating more ""formal"" jobs.

According to the latest results of MyHiringClub.com & JobPortal.co.in Employment Trend Survey (MJETS) 2017, that covered 6,790 companies across 12 industry sectors in 21 major cities, the organised sector in India is set to create about 8.75 lakh new jobs in 2017.

""In current economical and political condition manufacturing & engineering sector is the top list to create more new jobs in 2017,"" Rajesh Kumar, CEO, MyHiringClub.com & JobPortal.co.in said. Kumar said that ""tier II and tier III cities will create more new jobs compare to metros with companies preferring to set-up their units in these cities compared to metros and attrition will be lowest in 2017 since last 5 years"".

As per survey, Indian employees are expected to see an overall projected salary increase of 9 per cent per cent. Projected salary increases were highest in the manufacturing and engineering sector at 9.9 per cent, followed by banking and financial services at 9.7 per cent, while the lowest sectorial increments were in hospitality sectors at 5.3 per cent.

Though overall job market outlook looks a little bleak, top performers would have little to worry as companies would look at retaining talent as they would want to avoid cost incurred in hiring new talent, experts said.

According to workforce solutions provider Kelly Services India Managing Director Thammaiah BN, more global product companies are expected to setup their offshore operations in India creating a demand for skilled resources.

""We also expect a boost in contract jobs and skilled employees will be sought after. Central government's programmes such as Digital India, Smart Cities will see more companies capitalising on this opportunity. We expect 30,000 – 50,000 new IT jobs being added in 2017,"" it said.

Moreover, process, industrial sectors will also see an increase in employment because of urban infrastructure growing and the focus on smart cities. Building materials, cements, automation and the plastic sector will also see an increase in employment. Overall, these sectors will create upwards of 1,50,000 jobs in 2017, Thammaiah added.

The two key factors that are likely to impact certain sectors in the New Year are the Centre's demonetisation move and the election of Donald Trump as US President.
Some experts said that with Trump's emphasis on bringing jobs back to the US, his anti-immigrant stand and his stated aversion for H-1B Visa might have a negative impact on the Indian IT industry.

""On the surface it may seem that some manufacturing jobs may move back to the US, I believe the net impact will be positive, as the investments are stepped up,"" Suresh Raina, Managing Partner Hunt Partners, leadership talent advisory firm said. Moreover, Trump's anti-China stand also helps improved focus on India, again a positive. Indian industry including chemical, pharmaceuticals and engineering will be positively impacted by this shift, Raina said.

Post demonetisation, the positive side would see banks able to source fresh capital to give more loans to companies and strengthen economic growth. Sectors with a positive outlook for hiring will be Fintech, Infrastructure, and Financial Services including both small savings and payment banks. ""Digital payments have taken off, download of wallets has quadrupled in last few weeks. Payment banks and others in the transaction ecosystem will benefit,"" Raina added.

HR experts believe, the sectors that are likely to be in focus next year include big data and analytics as companies would need help to make sense of all of the data generated by technological disruptions. With people moving towards Internet of things (IoT) and automation, other key segments that would be in focus would be information security, cyber security.

""The sectors where hiring will pick-up include Energy, Pharma, non-banking financial companies (NBFC), small and payment banks, infrastructure. Rewarding Top talent will also have a significant component of non cash element,"" Raina added."

The Reserve Bank of India feels this query cannot be answered under the Right to Information Act as it does not comes under the definition of information under the transparency law.

The applicant wanted to know whether the ""views of Chief Economic Advisor Arvind Subramaniam and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley were taken before announcement was made"". ""Query is in the nature of seeking opinion from CPIO which is not defined as information as per Section 2(f) of the RTI Act,"" the RBI said in response to an RTI query. Asked whether the information sought will fall under ""seeking opinion"" from the CPIO, former Chief Information Commissioner A N Tiwari said, ""No. It does not. It is a fact sought by an RTI applicant. The CPIO cannot say an opinion has been sought from him.""

""How it can be called seeking opinion? Whether someone was consulted or not is a matter of record. Had the question been that should views be taken then it would mean taking opinion,"" former Information Commissioner Shailesh Gandhi said, expressing surprise at the response of RBI Central Public Information Officer.

The definition of information covers ""any material in any form, including records, documents, memos, e-mails, opinions, advices, press releases, circulars, orders, logbooks, contracts, reports, papers, samples, models, data material held in any electronic form and information relating to any private body which can be accessed by a public authority under any other law for the time being in force"".

The query was also sent to the Prime Minister's Office and the Finance Ministry but it remained unanswered even after 30 days of filing of the RTI application. The applicant had also sought to know the designation and the names of officials who were consulted before scraping of old Rs 500 and Rs 1000 currency notes. ""The information sought relates to sensitive matters pertaining to discontinuation/withdrawal of bank notes. The information is exempt from disclosure under Section 8(1)(a) and (g) of RTI Act,"" the RBI said.

The monetary policy regulator also did not disclose if the decision to demonetise currency notes worth Rs 20 lakh crore was opposed by any official or minister, saying the information sought is ""hypothetical"" in nature. It also cited Section 8(1)(a) of the RTI Act to deny minutes of deliberations related to demonetisation. Section 8(1)(a) of the RTI Act exempts from disclosure the information which would prejudicially affect the sovereignty and integrity of India, the security, strategic, scientific or economic interests of the State, relation with foreign State or lead to incitement of an offence.

Information sought under Section 8(1)(g) would endanger the life or physical safety of any person or identify the source of information or assistance given in confidence for law enforcement or security purposes. The RBI has been denying information related to crucial aspects related to demonetisation citing exemption clauses. It recently refused to give reasons behind the demonetisation move.

Earlier, it had denied to Mumbai-based RTI Activist Anil Galgali information about distribution of currency to banks between November 9 and November 19 citing Section 8(1)(g) of the RTI Act. The central bank did not give any reason as to how this section would apply in the case of information sought by Galgali.

RTI Activist Venkatesh Nayak, who was also denied deliberations on demonetisation by the RBI, said: ""While confidentiality prior to announcing the demonetisation decision is understandable, continued secrecy after its implementation is difficult to understand when people are facing problems due to shortage of cash."" He said the refusal to disclose the minutes of the board meeting where the decision was taken is ""perplexing""."

Besides, the tax department also has data on small cash deposits between Rs 30,000-50,000 made in 4.86 lakh accounts totaling to Rs 2,000 crore.

Between November 10-December 23, the total deposits in Jan Dhan accounts reported is Rs 41,523 crore in 48 lakh accounts. This, together with the total deposits of Rs 45,637 crore as on November 9, takes the aggregate amount in Jan Dhan accounts to over Rs 87,100 crore. ""All these information received on Jan Dhan Accounts are being dissected. If it is found that money deposited in these accounts belong to some other persons, necessary action will be taken at appropriate time,"" the official told PTI.

Cash deposit between Rs 30,000 and Rs 50,000 have been reported in 4.86 lakh accounts till November 30, taking the total deposits in such quantum to Rs 2,022 crore. The official further said that inflows of funds into Jan Dhan accounts was the highest in the first week after demonetisation at Rs 20,224 crore, but after that the deposits went down substantially.

""The inflow of funds in Jan Dhan accounts after the first two weeks was below Rs 5,000 crore per week and thereafter it got reduced to about Rs 1,000 crore per week,"" the official said, adding that the deposits have come down significantly after the tax department warned people not to allow their accounts to be misused for converting black money into white.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi had on November 8 announced junking of old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes, and replaced the currency with new Rs 2,000 and Rs 500 notes.
After setting a cash deposit limit of Rs 50,000 in Jan Dhan accounts, the government had on November 18 cautioned account holders that they will be prosecuted under the I-T Act for allowing misuse of their bank accounts through deposit of black money in Rs 500/1,000 notes during the 50-day window till December 30.

The directive came against the backdrop of reports that some are misusing other persons' bank accounts to convert their black money into new denomination notes. As per latest data available, Rs 12.10 lakh crore in form of old 500 and 1,000 rupee notes have returned into the banking system till December 12, 2016. It was estimated that now defunct notes constituted 86 per cent or Rs 15.45 lakh crore in circulation."

Similarly, Union Bank of India has reduced its MCLR by 0.65-0.9 per cent to 8.65 per cent, effective today. The revised one-year MCLR stands at 8.65 per cent.

Welcoming rate reduction by banks, Economic Affairs Secretary Shaktikanta Das said in a tweet, ""Trend of interest rate reduction follows demonetisation. Banks have substantial quantum of low cost funds now."" ""Welcome reduction of interest rates by SBI. Loan disbursements expected to pick up. Positive for the economy,"" he added. Yesterday, the Prime Minister had asked banks to pay special attention towards the need of poor and middle class.

""While respecting the autonomy of the banks, I appeal to them to move beyond their traditional priorities, and keep the poor, the lower middle class, and the middle class at the focus of their activities,"" he had said. Last week, SBI's subsidiary State Bank of Travancore had announced reduction in the lending rate, followed by another public lender IDBI which cut base interest rate by up to 0.6 per cent. Banks have moved to MCLR as their new benchmark lending rate from June, replacing the base rate system for new borrowers. It is calculated on the marginal cost of borrowing and return on net worth for banks. It was introduced by RBI to ensure fair interest rates to borrowers as well as banks."

Currently, Blue Dart and QuikJet are the only two domestic players operating cargo carriers.

Jet Airways had announced plans to set up a cargo airline in 2015, and had even got Government’s in-principle approval for leasing of a freighter from its strategic investment partner Etihad. However, the airline later shelved the plans, citing market conditions.

Raju said there is a need to motivate entities for air cargo operations.
Even as the domestic passenger growth has been over 20% for many months, cargo segment is lagging behind.

The national civil aviation policy has also given thrust to boosting air cargo business, especially against the backdrop of rising e-commerce activities and exports.

According to him, the world’s largest airline is FedEx, which is completely cargo, and even Indian aviation started with cargo. Raju added that targets are being set and the country is poised for good growth."

For them, the transplant procedure was beyond their means. But for the generosity of the hospital, the patient’s wife said, her husband would not have lived.

Shivappa (name changed) is the first beneficiary of a heart transplant at the Sri Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences and Research (SJICSR) in the city that took place early on Saturday morning. For three months now, his family has been spending day and night with him at the hospital.

His wife Dakshayini told DH, “I was told that my husband had to be put on artificial support as his condition worsened. Transplant option was beyond our reach. I believed that doctors in Jayadeva would help and they did.”

The 40-year-old, who works as a security guard, has just enough savings to pay for the hospital expenses.

A transplant would cost anywhere between Rs 15 lakh and Rs 25 lakh at private hospitals. At the government-run autonomous SJICSR, it is just Rs 6 lakh. With the family unable to afford even this, the hospital footed part of the medical expenses.

Shivappa was rushed to the hospital with severe breathlessness and inability to walk in October 2016. On examination, he was diagnosed with Dilated Cardiomyopathy, a condition where the chambers of the heart are enlarged, making it difficult for the heart to pump blood. The patient’s pumping capacity had come down to 20%.

On Friday, at 3 pm, doctors at Jayadeva were informed about a possible match for this patient. Mario Shin Yuan Huang, who had slipped off the rooftop of a building, was admitted to Manipal Hospitals with serious head injuries. He was later declared brain-dead. Relatives were counselled and doctors at SJICSR were alerted.

“We started working on it soon after. We sought clearances from the Zonal Co-ordination Committee of Karnataka for Organ Transplantation. The donor’s family wanted to offer some prayers and we were asked to begin the organ harvesting only after midnight,” recalled Dr C N Manjunath, director, SJICSR.

A team of doctors, Dr Arul Dominic, Dr A M Jagadeesh, Dr Girish Gowda, Dr L Sridhar, Dr Ravi S Math, Dr Prabhakar, Dr J Naveen, headed by Dr Seetharama Bhat, performed the transplant. The team rushed to Manipal Hospitals and harvested his heart. A green corridor was created to transport the organ and a four-hour procedure followed. The recipient is stable, said Dr Manjunath.

Political parties seem to be outdoing each other to wish people a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year at the cost of the city’s aesthetics. With this, not a single lamp post has been spared of a flex board or a poster. Political messages have even outnumbered commercial advertisements.

Though all three main political parties -- Congress, BJP and the JD(S) -- are guilty, the Congress appears to be the “winner” of the “advertisement war” since the area is represented by party MLA Byrathi Basavaraj. Basavaraj’s supporters have put up these illegal posters, banners, flex boards and hoardings featuring his picture.

Madhav Prasad, a fruit vendor in KR Puram, said this is not new in this area. “It has been going on for many years. Earlier, it was Nandish Reddy, and now it is Basavaraj.”

He added that often there is a clash between various groups over the posters. “Sometimes, supporters of a particular party clash among themselves on finding their photographs missing from the posters,” said Prasad.

BBMP Commissioner N Manjunath Prasad said that though the Palike has filed 200 FIRs in this regard, the practice is still prevalent. “We file FIRs but offenders come out on bail and resume their old practice,” said Prasad.

He ordered the BBMP control room to instruct all joint commissioners to strictly remove all illegal posters and hoardings. BBMP’s taxation and finance committee chairman said, “There is a high court order prohibiting illegal posters, banners and flex boards but still it is flouted due to the negligence of zonal-level joint commissioners.”"
"JAN 01 2017, 02:07 IST",City,"Bengaluru, Jan 1, 2017, DHNS,",City revellers get the better of cash shortage,"New Year’s Eve revellers seem to have got the better of cash shortage by making digital payments at pubs, bars and restaurants. Watering holes and eateries made brisk business as the last day of the year wound up.

Most people who booked slots for the New Year’s Eve party at a popular cafe in southern Bengaluru paid online or by credit/debit card, according to a staffer. Coconut Grove, a popular restaurant on Church Street, saw a good crowd despite few cash transactions, said its manager, Arvind D. “All customers paid by card,” he added.

Malls, too, were crowded and stayed open till 1 am. Garuda Mall, in central Bengaluru, which closes by 10 pm on other days, remained open till 1 am.

Some Bengalureans, however, gave outdoor parties a miss and instead opted for house get-togethers to save costs on account of cash shortage. Vijay N, a resident of Jayanagar, said that he didn’t travel with friends on New Year’s Eve and was instead hosting a house party to cut down on expenses.

Ruam Mukherjee, a resident of Cooke Town, said, “I don’t like big fat New Year’s Eve parties but prefer spending time with people who matter to me. House parties also help to cut costs.”

PM ‘lets down’ guzzlers
At Church Street Social, a pub in Koramangala, more than 50 people were watching with bated breath Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s scheduled speech on television on Saturday evening. The pub had an offer: every time the prime minister uttered his favourite word ‘Mitron’, patrons would get a shot glass of beer at just Rs 31. But to their disappointment, Modi didn’t oblige them. The offer was available at the pub chain’s all branches in Bengaluru where the speech was screened live."
"JAN 01 2017, 02:13 IST",City,"Bengaluru: Jan 1, 2017, DHNS,",Brigade Rd keeps date with New Year's Eve revelry,"The usual sight of bumper-to-bumper cars on Brigade Road was replaced by a sea of people with their hands up in the air counting down to 2017.

Unlike the previous years, the lights on Brigade Road were not switched off for the New Year countdown for safety reasons. But this did not dampen the euphoria of the crowd as it whistled and cheered.  MG Road and the surrounding areas began to swell as early as 7 pm with revellers old and young. Bright red lights from devil-horn headbands moved up and down Brigade Road and Church Street.

These and flowery tiaras were being bought in dozens by party-goers. Everyone had their phones out, clicking selfies to show their friends what they were doing to welcome the New Year.

All the watering holes in and around the central business district were full with many waiting for their turn to enter. Besides the branded restaurants, roadside eateries and vendors selling people masks, balloons and plastic trumpets also did brisk business. Notwithstanding the impact of demonetisation, people came out in large numbers to welcome the New Year. Almost all star hotels and clubs were full.

R Nakum and his family were celebrating their first New Year in Bengaluru. “We were just roaming around and we came to MG Road. Our friends told us what it would be like here but we were not prepared to see crowds in such a celebratory mood,” he said.

Exams and studies took a backseat on New Year’s Eve. Manisha S, a final-year engineering student, was out with her friends on Brigade Road. “Our exams will begin in two days but we wanted to come out and check out the craziness here,” she said.

Another student, Sai Prashanti, used the occasion to pursue her passion. “I love photography and the scene here is perfect for experimenting with my camera. I got many interesting bouquet shots of the decorative lights,” she said with excitement.

In 2017, the resolution is to not make any resolutions. “Every year, we come up with crazy ideas like getting six-pack abs. Halfway through the year, it doesn’t work out. So this year, I am not making any promises to myself,” said Brahmadutt Nair, an engineering student. The same goes for Sarika, a class 10 student, who did not manage to fulfil her resolutions to grow her hair long and do better in school. Her mother Solai, however, has not given up yet. “I am a woman entrepreneur, so my resolution is to work hard and improve my business,” she said.

Police, supported by CCTV cameras, kept an eye on the revellers to prevent untoward incidents.
DH News Service"
"JAN 01 2017, 02:20 IST",City,"Mythri Bangalore, Jan 1, 2017, DHNS,",Passengers seek more rail heads in Bengaluru,"The call for a suburban railway service for Bengaluru has grown louder, with residents demanding the introduction of a well-connected railway network to ease the traffic woes of the city. Bengaluru is the only major metropolitan city that has no dedicated rail-based mass transit system. 

The state government’s proposal to implement the suburban railway service has not translated into reality. Commuters are forced to travel in crowded long-distance trains and a skeletal local train service from Bangarpet, Tumakuru and Mandya to reach places within the city. The citizens’ demand is that the available railway infrastructure be utilised efficiently to implement the suburban rail network.

However, the draft policy on Suburban Rail System released by the Centre recently states that the existing railway infrastructure cannot be utilised to run suburban services as it would affect the services of long-distance and freight trains.

A South Western Railway (SWR) official, who preferred to be anonymous, contends that the city railway station is too congested to run new trains. “It is impossible to run additional suburban services with the infrastructure available,” he says.

SWR, he informs, has submitted a proposal to the state government to facilitate doubling of the line between Yeshwantpur and Hosur and introduce an additional line between Bengaluru and Bangarpet. Another proposal for implementation of automatic signalling has also been submitted. “Only then can suburban services be introduced,” the official notes.

The need of the hour, he says, are new terminals such as the one proposed at Baiyappanahalli. This should be constructed at the earliest to help decongest the city railway station. Also, switching from conventional to mainline electrical multiple unit (MEMU) coaches can help in enhancement of train capacity, he opines.

One solution offered to deal with the congestion of the city railway station is to terminate trains coming in from suburban areas of Yeshwantpur, Kengeri and Baiyappanahalli and have the commuters switch to Metro trains.

However, many passengers do not see merit in this option. Says Ramanna, a superintendent at a city college, “Switching between different modes of transport can be very difficult for daily commuters. Not only is it time consuming, but is also very expensive.”

People who commute between Bengaluru and the suburbs use railway passes.  “If they are asked to take the Metro from points where trains terminate, they will have to spend more money purchasing Metro passes.” He points out that commuting from the railway terminals to the Metro stations is yet another difficult proposition in the absence of adequate shuttle facilities.

Increasing the frequency of trains to suburbs can help people from all walks of life, he believes.
If train services can be increased in the peak hours, it can help thousands of passengers, unlike the Metro which has a diminished capacity, many passengers say.

However, Balaji Chitra Ganesan, a research engineer at IBM, has a different take on the matter. “One solution to decongest the city railway station could be to stop long-distance trains at terminals short of the central station. Such a precedent exists in Paris where none of the three major railway stations are in the city centre. Commuters can then switch to the Metro,” he says.

Ganesan is of the opinion that the clamour for the suburban railway service stems from the citizens’ frustration with the delay in implementing the Metro rail. Once a full-fledged Metro network is developed, it can solve many of the city’s traffic problems, he says.

The hurdles to the implementation of a suburban railway network in Bengaluru are many. However, it can happen only if a viable solution for decongesting the city railway station is arrived at."
"JAN 01 2017, 02:25 IST",City,"Rasheed Kappan, Bengaluru, Jan 1, 2017, DHNS,",Decongesting rail terminals,"Packed with long-distance trains, all its tracks perennially occupied, the city railway station is not everyone’s terminal. The Yeshwantpur station was upgraded to decongest, but is caught up in operational issues. Can a new terminal at Baiyappanahalli be the game-changer?

Bengaluru’s collective, 33-year-old yearning for a suburban rail network has always had a stock response from the Railways and Centre: The tracks are saturated and its stations, space-starved. Can some smart use of available space free up the existing terminals?

For decades, the city station, now named after Krantivira Sangolli Rayanna, with its 10 platforms, has remained Bengaluru’s premier rail head. Severe space-crunch forced the South Western Railway to acquire a part of the Binny Mill land from BBMP. But a project, sanctioned in 2013, to build a shunting yard there, is still stuck.

Here’s why: No access. A main road passes right across the land, and a plan to build a road underbridge with reinforced concrete cement (RCC) has not worked due to the multiplicity of underground utility lines.  

The implications are clear. No shortcuts can work. A long-term alternative, as urban rail analyst Sanjeev Dyamannavar suggests, could be to dig up the entire area, build a proper four lane road and top it. This way, any number of tracks can be laid above, decongesting the city station.

Dedicated shunting yard
Lack of a dedicated shunting yard forces long-distance trains to be parked on tracks between the platforms. The pit lines and stabling lines run parallel to the platforms, blocking trains coming from the Cantonment side. The decongestion by shifting these lines to the Binny Mill land will be dramatic.

To introduce a fully functional commuter rail/suburban network for the city, freeing up tracks between stations/terminals is critical. Consultancy firm RITES had even recommended tripling/quadrupling the lines, so that suburban trains could be run on two lines at a frequency of five minutes during peak hours.  

How does this plan fit into the available land between the City and Yeshwantpur terminals? Currently, the two biggest stations of Bengaluru are connected only by two tracks. Any chance of fitting in two more tracks has vanished with the Okalipuram bridge built by BBMP, points out Dyamannavar.

South Western Railway had parted with the land in exchange for the Binny Mill land. The bridge ramps are so designed that they rule out any additional tracks on that stretch. Future expansion is clearly out.

Inter-terminal linkage
This critical connectivity issue poses a big challenge for a seamless suburban network. But the Yeshwantpur terminal has another operational issue to sort out: The railway gate on the Outer Ring Road (ORR) cutting across the line towards Chikkabanavara station.

Due to high traffic on ORR, the police do not allow the gate to be closed for long durations. Long-distance trains from the city station are often stuck at platforms 1, 2 and 3 of Yeshwantpur station.

Unless these trains are allowed to move on to Chikkabanavara, trains from the city station are not given the green signal to proceed to Yeshwantpur. Result: Congestion at both the terminals. The 4th, 5th and 6th platforms at the Yeshwantpur station are occupied by inter-city trains that depart from the terminal.

Opening the road overbridge at the railway gate can potentially solve the problem. Trains can then leave the first three platforms in three minutes, accelerating incoming rail traffic from the city station side and back. 

Yeshwantpur terminal extension
Once the operational issues are sorted out, the Railways could ideally think of a terminal extension or even a second terminal. Space should not be an issue, provided a factory that manufactures cement sleeper blocks for broad guage lines is shifted from the far-end of the station.

Railways had even offered a four-acre land to shift the facility outside the city. The move is being resisted. But if the area is cleared, eight to 10 tracks can be planned towards Tumakuru, up from the current three. The pit and stabling lines too could be extended, freeing up more space.

Only two tracks connect the city station with Baiyappanahalli station. But Railways has enough land – about 130 acres - for a full-fledged terminal.

Over the last four years, Rs. 20 crore has been spent to lay additional pit and stabling lines. Tenders were again called and awarded in October 2016 for three platforms, a pit line to clean and maintain coaches and other facilities, inform South Western Railway officials.

Baiyappanahalli project
The Rs 116-crore project envisages building eight platforms, six pitlines and stabling lines, station buildings, foot overbridges, signals and other associated installations.

Foundation stone for the project is expected to be laid in the second week of January. Once the terminal is commissioned as planned some time in 2018, a few inter-city trains are likely to terminate here without heading to the city station.

A full-fledged terminus at Baiyappanahalli, a decongested city railway station and an optimally utilised Yeshwantpur terminal, all linked by tripled or quadrupled tracks could effectively pave the way for a functional suburban rail network.

A sustained, coordinated approach by all stakeholders including citizens could make it happen. But is everyone moving in the same direction?

Linking Metro with SWR terminals
Seamless inter-modal transport connectivity implies helping commuters to switch from Namma Metro to a South Western Railway terminal or vice-versa. It is a reality at Baiyappanahalli, where a bridge funded by Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) links the Metro terminal with the SWR station. In two years, the station is proposed to be upgraded to a terminal.

But this connection is glaringly lacking at Yeshwantpur, where the Metro station and SWR terminal are only a few metres apart.Thousands of commuters climb up and down stairs, lugging heavy baggage and cross the busy roads underneath to switch over. The SWR and BMRCL are yet to strike a cost-sharing deal on a bridge that would make it all easy. 

Once the Metro phase I is fully launched with the green and purple lines intersecting at the Majestic station, the connectivity with the city railway station will have to be seamless. Currently, the Majestic Metro station has a single exit point, from where access to the city station is cumbersome.

Commuters are forced to walk 200-300 metres, step down to an underpass and climb up before heading to the ticket counters and platforms through another bridge.

A second entrance is from the Metro’s underground city station that leads to the 10th platform of the SWR station near Okalipuram. But it is a good walking distance away. A third entry route is now in the pipeline. This route will help commuters cross the Gubbi Thotadappa Road directly from the Majestic metro station, leading to the city station platforms."
"JAN 01 2017, 23:03 IST",Archives,"Brian X Chen, Jan 02, 2017, International New York Times,",Five ways to make your tech life better,"In 2017, why not try a new kind of New Year’s resolution? Instead of just hitting the gym and dropping some pounds, consider changing some personal habits to simplify the tech in your life.

If you are like most people, there are things you do with tech that could use some tweaking. Strengthening your password security, for one, would benefit you tremendously in an era when hacks are rampant. For another, purging the e-junk you have accumulated over the years would help the environment and your sanity. While you’re at it, start doing maintenance on your electronics to make sure they work smoothly this year.

Here are my top recommendations for resolutions to abide by to make tech less frustrating in the new year.

Clean up your password hygiene

You are probably using the same password across multiple websites for banking, shopping, social media and email.

That’s understandable: A person can only memorise so many passwords. But in 2016, Yahoo reminded everybody that reusing passwords is a very bad idea, after it revealed that 500 million Yahoo accounts were compromised in 2014, in addition to 1 billion accounts that were hacked in 2013. If your Yahoo account password was the same as ones you used elsewhere, those accounts were vulnerable, too.

Start off 2017 by spending a few hours logging into each of your accounts and creating unique, strong passwords. To make this easier, use applications like LastPass or 1Password, which are password-managing apps that let you use one master password to unlock a vault of passwords to log in to all of your internet accounts. They also automatically generate strong passwords for you.

Then add an extra layer of protection by enabling two-factor verification on your accounts whenever the option is available. When you enter your password, you will receive a message (usually a text) with a one-time code that you must enter before logging in.

Taking these two simple steps will help safeguard you from the inevitable hacks that arise this year.

Maintain your devices

After regular use, our smartphones and computers start to feel sluggish and short-lived, but a bit of maintenance can make them feel brand new.

First, check the condition of your batteries. With iPhone and iPads, you can hook the devices up to a Mac and run the app coconutBattery, which reveals battery statistics. With Android devices, you can use the app Battery by MacroPinch. If your battery is on its last legs, it’s time to order a new one or schedule an appointment at a repair shop to replace it.

If your devices feel sluggish, freeing up some storage can also make a dramatic difference. Start by purging apps you never use anymore. Then do something about those photos you never look at: back up all your photos to the cloud using services like Google Photos and then delete them from your device to start the new year with a fresh photo roll.

Show your gadgets some physical love, too. Give your screens a good wipe with a wetted cloth. If you own a desktop computer, open it up and use compressed air to blow out the dust.

Do this basic maintenance every six months and your devices will run smoothly for many years.

Mind your infrastructure

We don’t hesitate to buy new smartphones every two years — but that neglected, ugly Wi-Fi router tucked away in the corner of the living room may be the most important tech product to upgrade every few years. Among all tech headaches, there is nothing more annoying than a sluggish, spotty internet connection.

Start off each new year by doing some checks on your internet infrastructure. If your router is more than three years old, you probably need a new one that is compatible with today’s faster, smarter wireless standards. If you are relying on a router provided by your broadband provider, you should probably buy a more powerful stand-alone router.

The Wirecutter, a product-recommendations website owned by The New York Times, recommends TP-Link’s Archer C7 as the best router for most people. (If you have less technical know-how, I recommend the Wi-Fi system from Eero, which offers a smartphone app that holds your hand through the network setup.)

Be less wasteful

Unused gadgets and power cables take up lots of space in drawers and attics. This e-waste would be better off sold or donated to someone in need, or recycled for their precious metals.

During spring cleaning season, make plans to get this unwanted junk out of your life. Companies like Amazon and Gazelle offer headache-free trade-in services for selling used electronics. Just punch in the gadget you are trying to trade in, like a used iPhone or Samsung Galaxy device, and the sites offer a quote for how much money or Amazon store credit you can get in exchange for the gear. Then pack up the outdated hardware, slap on a shipping label, drop it off at a shipping centre and wait for the money to roll in.

There is bound to be unsellable e-junk in your pile. Fortunately, all Best Buy locations will recycle your used electronics for free. Just bag the items up and drop them off at the store’s customer-service counter, and the retailer will take care of the rest.

Be a smarter shopper

To get great deals on electronics, there is no need to wait until Black Friday or Cyber Monday. Carefully research high-quality, long-lasting items you want and buy them when their prices drop a significant amount. This technique can be used when online shopping for just about anything, but especially for tech products that decrease in price as they age.

Web tools like Camel Camel Camel and Keepa make price tracking on Amazon.com easy. On their websites, just do a search on the name of the item, and the sites will pull up a price history. From there, you can create a tracker to alert you via email whenever a price drops to a desired amount.

Many deals that emerge throughout the year are as good, or better, than the ones on Black Friday. You just have to know how to spot them.

Another way to save money is to consider buying used products whenever possible. Be on the lookout for sales of used or refurbished electronics from reputable brands like Apple, GameStop, Amazon and Gazelle. Before you buy a used item, read about its condition carefully: Often, products sold as used were barely touched before they were returned by a customer, or they were restored to good-as-new condition by a refurbishing centre."
"JAN 01 2017, 21:54 IST",Business,"Gaurav Khurana, Jan 02, 2017,",Retail trends to watch out for in 2017,"The Indian Retail Industry has undergone a paradigm shift from a product-oriented industry to a more marketing-focused industry with the customer taking centre stage. The customer today is spoilt for choice owing to diverse factors like multiple brand choices, extremely attractive value propositions and availability of content 24X7 due to various social platforms and technological access.

Also, there are radical changes and explosions in the retail landscape with the emergence of new age ecommerce players giving the larger organised players a run for their money. All this explosion is resulting in mad rush for new customer acquisition, however, the same is fuelled largely by deep discounting, which in the longer run is unlikely to be sustainable as discounting is very transactional in nature, and does not build any engagement with the customer over time.

Trends give us a purview of the latest market dynamics that influence shopper behaviour. Loyalty programmes bring retention and long-term focus on customer trends, usage, and social media behaviour to the retail sector. Keeping this in view, 2017 predicts a stronger, more efficient, agile strategy for retail ecommerce and loyalty programmes.

Eye on trends

Personalised Services: The future of services is increasingly pushing for higher demand. With a pragmatic approach, the interface between companies, brands and customers will improve. Social media conversation tracking is going to be trending in 2017, which is a ground-breaking path to the future of handling customer behaviour and deliver tailor-made solutions.

Data is king: In a world, which is fuelled by the Internet and smartphone penetration, it is very clear that data is king. Technology has come a long way, from the numerous promotional campaigns to personalised offers for a customer by tracking their choice of products and transaction details. Pricing plays an important role in data analysis; luxury brands that are looking at protecting their positioning are consistently changing their interface and adopting new measures of communication.

Connected devices: The future of ecommerce lies in the hands of connected devices. Large players have immersed their data research into further enhancing their customer experience by simply placing Wi-Fi chips that update automatically. Thus, any depleting item automatically updates itself sending the customer a message and issuing an order for replenishments. This further leads to the building of brand loyalty and adds a treasure trove of consumer behavioural data.

Pricing architecture: The price war will become a point of conversation with the latest 2017 trends in the retail structure of the future. Big data, interactive mediums, and IoT devices have broken the traditional shopping journey. The brick and mortar formats are undoubtedly trendy and cool, but with the advancement of ecommerce platforms, these off-line stores are getting old school.

Consumer Trends: Online beats the brick and mortar format in the age of IoT. As the future of ecommerce grows, retailers will realise that the breadth of an online store clearly has more advantages, when compared with the offline stores. Online has great potential to innovate and curate an assortment of items. This will enhance the customer experience in the future, as more and more shoppers are moving to the Internet of Things and increasing their choice of buying power.

Loyalty trends to watch in 2017

Omni-channel: From the brick and mortar to the online ecommerce stores, the need to adopt to the ever-changing landscape of retailing and consumer behaviour is by using all platforms of communication to reach the customer. This will help the industry accurately track real-time data and analyse the tendencies of a single shopper.

Omni-channel changes the way we deal with a shopper, this route will give brands, and e-retailers a chance to pursue a certain trend or season. Furthermore, it will help enhance customer approach behaviour and build loyalty between the brand, the store, and the customer.

Single-view and cloud solutions: In today’s world, where online experiences are based on fast-paced interactions, push emails and mass campaigns have become obsolete. Most customers’ tendency is to delete promotional e-mailers. And with the introduction of advanced technology every now and then, it clearly seems that 2017 will change methods of customer tracking and behaviour. In a mobile-first world, tracking transactional and behavioural data will emerge as a game-changer.

Partnerships between brands: Data analytics prove that 2017 will bring improved results for brands who are in the process of developing agile systems to track social media conversations. Counting the number of visitors to a website or the number of likes, followers, and favourites, now come in the ‘old methods’ list. This is the point where big data analytics and partnerships step in. It will help in bringing brands closer to the customer through various loyalty programmes, while building a better and more effective communication channel for the customer.

Personalised exclusivity: The year 2017 is all about leveraging the mobile world. With a multi-channel approach towards marketing to customers, brands have to focus on the bigger picture. Research and thorough tracking of social media content will help in targeting the customer seamlessly by avoiding unnecessary promotional messages and mass campaigns.

Customer retention: Every individual shopper wants personal recognition. While loyalty programmes offer rewards to existing customers, the challenge is the acquisition of new customers. Innovation in content is the key to retaining and acquiring customers.

"JAN 01 2017, 21:57 IST",Business,"Sagar Kulkarni, Jan 02, 2017, DHNS,","'No dearth of money in the country, we need to recognise our strength'","Swadeshi brand Patanjali Ayurved is working vigorously to get ahead of multinationals like Unilever in a year or two.

Proponent Ramdev, who is venturing into a host of areas such as textiles, dairy products and animal feed in a big way this year, has some advice for Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He should go slow on foreign direct investments. “There is no dearth of money within the country. We need to recognise our strength,” he tells DH’s Sagar Kulkarni. Excerpts:

You have achieved a turnover of Rs 5,000 crore. What is your next target?

My target is that within a year or two, multinationals like Unilever should be behind Patanjali. We are facing some headwinds due to demonetisation but a turnover of Rs 9,000 crore to Rs 10,000 crore should not be difficult next year.

How do you manage this vast business?

We make extensive use of technology. All our plants are monitored by CCTV cameras. All the key jobs in our units are done by volunteers and saints. These are highly motivated and committed people.

Aren’t there any professionals in key positions?

Our volunteers are professionals. They have become professionals by learning on-the-job. We do not employ commission agents. A commission business leads to decline in product quality. We do not compromise on raw material, neither have we compromised on equipment. Though we are proponents of Swadeshi, we have not shied away from importing better quality machines. Similarly in the field of science and technology, if a technology is better in foreign countries, we adopt. But let me tell you, all this has not happened overnight, we have taken 25 years to achieve this, develop ourselves to the level that you are seeing today. People often think that Patanjali has become enormous all of a sudden.

What is the extent of the hit Patanjali has taken due to demonetisation?

As of now, it is not much. As I said, we are not worried much about demonetisation. In some areas we have witnessed a 10%-20% growth, in others, we have taken a 10% hit. But, this is not uniform everywhere, it varies from district to  district. It depends on the working ability, skill of the person concerned. Mostly, it is because demonetisation has affected people’s purchasing capacity.

You started off with Ayurvedic medicines and now cover sectors such as detergents and food products? Do you plan to expand to any more areas?

We are focusing on four areas and textiles is one. The range is from kids to men and women. Our mission is — from coat to langot (undergarment), everything should be Swadeshi.

Another is dairy. Including milk, cheese, curd, buttermilk and srikhand, we are introducing all milk products. Ghee is already our best selling one. We are also focusing on animal feed. We plan to produce urea-free animal feed, where other players add between 1% and 2% urea to animal feed. Such animal feed leads to infertility among animals. Initially, the milk output per animal increases, so people start believing that it is effective, but later the problems begin. There is a scam in this. They also mix sand. Because of sand, animals experience stomach upset and urea makes them prone to infertility.

Dugdhamirt, Patanjalli’s animal feed brand to be launched this year, should fetch us Rs 500 crore every fiscal. We are also working on silage to address the problem of malnutrition among animals. We will be working on thousands of acres of land, particularly, maize and bajra that have nutrients required for animals. Silage is not produced by the organised sector, hence we are venturing into it in a big way.

The fourth area is puja saamagri (items used in religious rituals) under the brand name Aastha.

You had also talked about developing new indigenous cow breeds?

That is a separate project. We will breed cows that will give 30-50 litres of milk. We are getting the embryos and semen of the cows and bulls, respectively, that were exported to Brazil several years ago. Or, we can carry out artificial insemination to produce high-milk producing cows. This work will also begin this year.

You have always favoured Swadeshi and often said that you want to rid India of MNCs. Does this not run contrary to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s scouting for increased FDI?

MNCs control a market of Rs 50 lakh crore. They take back to their countries lakhs of crore rupees in the form of royalties. We have a dream of ridding the country of this economic loot and slavery. Our basic concept is that we have to give this country economic freedom. We got political freedom in 1947, now we have to deliver economic freedom. This is our resolve. There is no clash with Modiji in this. A person occupying  a constitutional post cannot speak in this language because he is bound by international treaties and agreements with the WTO. I am not bound by any treaties or agreements, I can speak freely about Swadeshi and other issues. Yes, Modiji has spoken a lot about FDI, but now I feel that even he would speak less about FDI. Because, so much money has been unearthed within the country (after demonetisation).

What about expansion plans?

We are starting food parks at five places. We already have a food park in Haridwar. Now, we are opening food parks in Nagpur, Noida, Tezpur, and Indore. We can cover the entire country through this. We plan to expand to southern India too. We would like to have small units every where. We can work on a large scale in Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka.

How do you see the demonetisation initiative?

This is a courageous step. There will be difficulties in the beginning but this will put the economy back on track. Bank, RBI, Income Tax, Service Tax, Sales Tax... they will be agressive from January 1."
"JAN 01 2017, 21:59 IST",Business,"Hrithik Kiran Bagade, Jan 02, 2017, DHNS,","Home is where the heart is, as found by Design Cafe","If there is ever a feeling to sweeten the essence of the adage ‘home sweet home’, a Bengaluru-based technology-driven interior design firm has unearthed the nectar.

It was in 2012 that Design Café began to help realise the dreams of many a home owner, initially serving the demand from the wealthier segments. After having worked on interiors of 200 properties across Bengaluru, Belagavi, Hubballi and Chennai, founders Shezaan Bhojani and Gita Ramanan, decided to tap the needs of the burgeoning mid-segment (homes in the range of Rs 50 lakh to Rs 1.5 crore) — in the process, leveraging technology to make the whole exercise a lot more organised, as also an immersive experience.

“Specifically, people with homes in the range of Rs 70 lakh to Rs 1.5 crore, require an interior budget of Rs 5-15 lakh, for which, they opt for a less-professional freelancer, or a smaller firm,” Bhojani tells DH.

“We wanted to scale business to this big segment, and turn the whole process of design and building more professional. In November 2015, we launched our own website, which we pre-designed themes, rooms, and fixtures, to be savoured by customers,” he adds.

Design Café offers an entire suite of interior design solutions — kitchen, bathroom, living room, bedroom, furniture, furnishings, curtains, and lighting, and so on. And, technology has played a vital role in charting the firm’s onward journey, along with aiding customers in their home creation.

“We use technology in the building process itself. Once an order is placed with us for an entire home, it can actually be tracked. We have 40-50 designers, and an IT team,” Bhojani says.

As a home owner or a customer, one needs to get onto Design Café’s website, and one can see the design range, including the selection of paints and curtains. By clicking on an option, the firm can customise the same in a day or two, completing a home in about 59 days, ensuring timeliness and quality. Among other things, the website also boasts of the ‘Design Your Kitchen’ feature.

“When people visit our website and select a design, they can then choose to meet an expert, and fix up an appointment online, or call our helpline. They will meet our designer at our experience centre, who’ll understand their requirement, and offer customisations and suggestions. If they like it, we go for production. Customers can also experience a complete home in virtual reality,” he adds. There is an experience centre and an office in Bengaluru, and another experience centre is opening here.

Over 70% of Design Café’s focus is on apartments, with the remaining is on tapping villas.

In the last one year, it has signed up 100 homes and aims to close Series A funding next month. The firm plans expansion to Mumbai and Delhi in 2017, and is vying to secure Rs 500 crore in revenues by 2020.  "
"JAN 01 2017, 22:03 IST",Business,"Umesh M Avvannavar, Jan 02, 2017, DHNS,",HealthEminds aims at 2K online therapy sessions each month,"At her multi-speciality clinic in Whitefield, Bengaluru, Dr Sunita Maheshwari noticed that the counsellors there are not that busy, as they should be, given the high incidence of depression and stress in India.

According to a World Health Organisation (WHO) study, India is home to the largest number of depressed individuals. The WHO World Mental Health Survey 2010, also lists suicide as the third largest cause of death among the age group of 15–35-years. India accounts for 32% of the world’s suicides.

With domain expertise in the use of technology in healthcare, and her experience in teleradiology solutions that she and her husband Dr Arjun Kalyanpur founded, there came the idea of tele-counselling to help patients with mental health needs.

Both Dr Sunita and Ankita Puri co-founded Bengaluru-based HealthEminds, which is a telemedicine venture working in the field of psychology towards building an ecosystem of mental wellbeing by way of offering counselling services. The startup provides video counselling while keeping the identity of the caller anonymous. It charges anywhere between Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 per session depending on the professional. It aims to do at least 2,000 online therapy sessions each month on the platform.

 “We are spreading awareness about various mental health concerns and issues using technology. We are a tele-counselling service where patients can access counsellors for their mental health issues from the privacy of their home,” HealthEminds Head of Counselling Aruna Arumugum told DH.

“We believe in a holistic approach and provide various types of psychiatry and counselling services which are integrated with a secure and confidential online technology platform. We have in-house counselling psychologists and associated consultants consisting of psychiatrists, psychologists, counsellors, life coaches, nutritionists, and alternative therapists spread across India and abroad,” Aruna added. HealthEminds works with 60 mental healthcare professionals nationally, and is targeting to increase this number to 200 by the end of the calendar year. Apart from self-funding by both — Dr Sunita and Dr Kalyanpur, the startup also received undisclosed funding from cricketer Robin Uthappa and Tennis player Arjun Goutham.

On challenges, Dr Sunita said, “The experience has been both challenging and rewarding. Challenging for two reasons: not everyone is open to the idea of counselling, and those who are not always open to the idea of online sessions and prefer face-to-face. However, it has been a rewarding experience again for two reasons: scaling access to counselling that has been a taboo culturally in India, and being among the first online tele-counselling ventures in India offering people a safe, secure and supportive solution to their mental health needs.”"

Justice Rajiv Sahai Endlaw issued the direction to Shemaroo and its Joint Managing Director (JMD) on the plea of the son and daughter of the film's producer, Shankardas Kesarilal Shailendra, a reputed lyricist known for famous songs like 'Awaara Hoon', 'Mera Joota Hai Japani' and 'Gata Rahe Mera Dil'.

""The defendants no.1 and 2 (JMD and Shemaroo), till further orders, are restrained from making any further reproduction by distributing, selling, offering for sale, advertising through any media or platform the Hindi film 'Teesri Kasam' or substantial part thereof,"" the court said.

It also issued summons of suit and notice to defendants including some other heirs of Shailendra who had assigned their one-sixth share in the copyright of the film to Shemaroo, and listed the matter for hearing on January nine.

The order came on the plea by Amla Shailendra Mazumdar and Dinesh Kumar Shailendra, children of the lyricist, who have sought that Shemaroo and its JMD Atul Maru be stopped from distributing, selling, or broadcasting the film through any media or platform and they be restrained from assigning rights in the movie to any third party.

The two plaintiffs have also sought total damages of Rs 1,00,01,000 from Maru, Shemaroo and other three heirs, Gitanjali Shaily Shailendra, Riddhima Shaily Shailendra and Priyanka Shaily Shailendra who had entered into agreements with the media content house on October 8, 2012 and June 14, 2004 for assigning their one-sixth share in the copyright of the movie to it.

The suit also seeks an order declaring as null and void the two agreements.

Gitanjali is the wife of late Hemant Shaily Shailendra, the eldest of Shankar Shailendra's children, and Riddhima and Priyanka are their daughters.

According to the suit, prior to his death, Hemant used to get the royalties for the use of the film.

Amla Shailendra Mazumdar has claimed that she came to know about the violation of her copyright in the film when she saw that the movie was being offered as in-flight entertainment on an Emirates flight.

When she contacted the Dubai-based airline, it said it had got the right to show the film from Shemaroo which, according to the suit, has uploaded the entire movie on YouTube and also sells its DVDs on Flipkart."

"JAN 01 2017, 22:06 IST",Business,"Ajay Gupta, Jan 02, 2017,",Home loan default: tips to avoid pain,"The home loan financier and the customer have a symbiotic relationship. In the socio-economic backdrop of Indian society, it needs no reiteration how significant is the decision to purchase a house. The lender’s role is pivotal as it provides the buyer with the necessary bandwidth to choose her or his dream property.

However, make no mistake, the customer is equally pivotal to the housing finance lender: after all the operational robustness of the housing finance company is directly proportional to a healthy EMI recovery module.

In most cases, the process concludes smoothly as customer dutifully pays EMIs each month. In some cases, however, EMI is not paid on the due date or not paid at all, leading to a payment default. Typically, EMI defaults are temporary in nature. Payment defaults can occur on account of several unavoidable circumstances such as loss of steady income or a sudden additional expenditure or prolonged sickness that lead to financial distress. In rare instances, default may also occur due to untimely death of an individual. 

Financial institutions diligently monitor all the portfolios for any unusual triggers. Once the default occurs, the monitoring team flags the account to collection department, depending on their policies, the banks either make a call immediately or wait till the next month.

While not much can be done in case of rare cases, the temporary default can be managed by taking the following immediate measures: 

 First of all, inform the home finance company about the default. Usually these are amicable in nature, therefore, reach out to them and discuss your problem. This will result in a solution that is acceptable to you as well as the financier.

 Do not avoid contact with lenders. Not taking or responding to calls from the company leads to a feeling of mistrust, making the payment default appear intentional.

 Remember you owe the lender. As a customer, it is your moral and legal obligation to repay the loan with interest on the agreed time. Avoiding contact with them will only worsen the situation and create unnecessary mistrust issues which can ultimately lead to initiation of legal action by home finance company.

 Financial institutions are experienced in dealing with such situations and will try their best to resolve problems faced by genuine customers. If you approach lenders and convince them about your genuine problem, companies will usually be flexible in restructuring the loan and help you in re-initiating EMI payments.

 In the event you are unable to repay due to a protracted problem and the housing finance company (HFC) cannot resolve the issue and contemplates/launches follow-up action, you need to be aware that as a customer, you have certain rights.
Your rights as a customer

vis-à-vis the collections process:

 Make sure the company explains the repayment process in detail i.e. the amount, tenure, periodicity of the repayment, nature of dues, total overdues etc. In case of a default, all HFCs follow a defined process starting with reminding the customer of the default by sending a notice or by making personal visits.

 You can be contacted ordinarily at a place of your choice and in the absence of the specified place; the HFC can contact you at your residence or place of work.
 You have the right to ask for the identity card of the individual or the authority letter for representing the company. 

 HFC’s representatives can contact you between 7 am and 7 pm, unless you specify otherwise. In addition, your request to avoid calls at a particular time or place has to be honoured as far as possible. This is valid only if the company has been able to reach you and you have updated your contact details with the home financier.

 Ensure documentation of details such as time of visit, details of conversation.
 Inappropriate occasions such as bereavement in the family or other unfortunate occasions should be avoided for making calls/visits to collect dues provided the company or the relationship manager representing the company is aware of the unfortunate incident.

 Finally, since it is an obligation to repay the loan in time, timely and effective communication with the housing finance company helps in resolving issues quickly and amicably.

At the same time, be absolutely clear in understanding your rights as a customer. Financial institutions understand the customer’s emergencies and will work with you as long as you are transparent and upfront with them and do not default intentionally.

"JAN 01 2017, 22:09 IST",Business,"Saravana Kumar, Jan 02, 2017,",Investment opportunities in 2017,"2016 would be remembered for many landmark events which would significantly alter future course of investments. We tend to look at medium to long term potential of any investment idea while investing and tend to differentiate from the short term noise which might be there at the very moment.

Technically, attractiveness of investment is combination of growth prospects, capital efficiency and valuations ascribed.

Current correction has two legs

One argument is that India is more dependent on cash (proportion of sales; expenditures fulfilled in cash is higher) and demonetisation would take a toll on these sales. Here, very high growth assumption underlying the high valuations is tested for near term. Secondly, as demonetisation would lead to disruption of the unorganised section, the organised section may see strong positive boost.

By very nature of these two forces, first has immediate impact, whereas, second has slightly back ended or at best has mid-term impact if not a long term one.

Equity investment being a long term product, actually such disruption is good to have to weed out the weak from the system. Such weeding leads to surviving players reemerging as stronger.

Many sectors would see shift from unorganised fragmented businesses to organised consolidated businesses capable of dealing with future technological shifts, disruptions in a better manner.

Meanwhile, investors would continue reassessing expectations of these businesses and few stocks may still see sharp corrections.

Consumption sector

India’s long term thesis is intact or in fact getting even more attractive due to the government’s moves towards ease of doing business and bringing best out of organised sectors of the economy.

We believe for 2017 that those sectors which have been punished extensively by market would provide better risk-reward potential.

The idea here is not to bank on the mean reversion of multiples but understanding the true worth of the business and bank on long term fundamentals of the sectors and stocks.

We follow bottom up based valuation methodology and have realised over time that the industry is not the final destiny of the stock; in fact one may find highly rewarding stocks in a sector which is undergoing through disruption.

India is undergoing through metamorphosis – the way Indians spend which is underlying of majority of sectors is changing. As analysts may put – Indians spending pattern is going through fundamental shift towards discretionary spending. Share of wallet of discretionary items is expanding at the cost of staples.

Services like education, entertainment, communication, which are aspirational in nature are occupying more space in the wallet. We believe these sectors would be best placed to create value not only in 2017 but for next few years. If we look at aviation traffic growth and premium bike sales, these numbers are a tip of the iceberg of what is underlying in real economy.

At the same time, bottom of the pyramid is transforming – media’s far flung reach in the nook and corners of the nation has created strong aspirational mindset in the minds of consumers. Those who are still consuming products from the unorganised section of the industry are asking for branded consumer products. Upcoming GST framework, where organised section is expected to benefit immensely (at the cost of tax-avoiding businesses), is expected to propel this shift towards organised section.
In areas where fragmentation is high — e.g. luggage industry, entry-level consumer goods, are likely to see sharp jump of market shares in favour of organised sectors. These sectors would provide fantastic investment opportunities in years to come.

Industrial and Banking and Financial sector:

Finally, the industrial and banking sector cannot remain aloof from this growth for long. Growing India requires strong backbone of the banking and financial industry.

Insurance domain is in nascent stages in our country. Now, post-demonetisation it would not be surprising if our well banked society opts for the insurance services and provides a good value generation opportunity for multiple years. Once current capacities on industrial side are occupied, new capex cycle would start paving way for further opportunities in capital goods. Infrastructure will get a boost going forward. The National Highway Authority of India was constructing 2.4-lane km per day before the present government came into the picture. The latest data from NHAI indicates that it is executing nearly 26-lane km/ day. Infrastructure and construction-related stocks may get better in coming days.

"JAN 01 2017, 22:12 IST",Business,"Gautam Majumdar, Jan 02, 2017,",Why respecting debt makes sense,"Debt requires careful handling. It can reap dividends and alternatively can create havoc. The temptation to fall prey to raising loans is ever present as additional liquidity is always welcome.

How we manage debt determines our financial strength and mental peace. Without debt the economy would not prosper and development would not occur. But it is full of risk if debt management is defective and lacks planning.

The end use of debt has to be constructive for us to see its brighter side. Therefore the decision to raise debt should be well thought out. It should be for creating a productive asset. We need to ask ourselves whether we really need the loan. Will it create assets and generate funds for us or will it be a drain on our resources.

The questions we need to honestly answer would be:

 Is the loan really required? Is it for something worthwhile or just for pleasure or worse is it to increase/support the monthly income?

 Has my spending overshot the available resources, can I reduce my expenses, do I need to check any impulse buying?

 Do I need to control my expenses; am I following the 50:20:30 rule while using my resources? (50% towards essential expenses, 20% towards savings, 30% for lifestyle expenses). This is a financial thumb rule often suggested to keep a hold over individual’s expenses.

To appreciate the impact of expenses, I am inclined to quote Benjamin Franklin– ‘beware of little expenses; a small leak will sink a great ship.’ In case of a shift from practising the above rule where have I slipped? In case raising of debt becomes inevitable then ask.

What is my debt situation?

Is there scope for having another loan?

 How do I intend to repay it? (never borrow if you do not know how to repay it timely). Remember that servicing a loan would bring you face to face with the following probable situations:

 You would have to sacrifice some expenses to make the monthly loan instalment repayments, if you wish to remain within your budgeted expenses amount
 You would have to ensure that there is no slip in the monthly payments; you can postpone certain expenses but you cannot avoid loan repayments; you are asking for trouble if you do so The cost of the asset acquired would ultimately be much more with application of interest.

 The asset would continue to remain pledged/mortgaged till the loan is fully cleared.
 The asset except property, would depreciate over the period of the loan.
 If the loan is for holidays, consumption the debt would be unproductive. Education loans are also full of risks as the productive use is uncertain.
 You might have to face recovery agents in case there is default.

 In a worst case scenario you might have to face litigation and forfeiture of the asset if the loan amount remains unpaid.

 Improper conduct of a loan would mean an adverse credit score; without a proper credit score your credit profile would not qualify for any credit facility and in times to come, even availing of utility services make become difficult.

It is not that taking a loan would invariably turn out to be so scary, but undoubtedly the adverse prospects are possible, if we do not have a proper plan and a supporting budget to take care of the repayments. We need to respect debt as the downside of poor handling may damage our financial position. Debt for debt sake is never recommended. We are mortgaging our future income when we take loans for serving our present wants and aspirations. Financial prudence is the key to effective management of our finances.

It is not the intention to suggest that all debt is bad; it can never be as otherwise banks would fold up. Economy would not prosper and there would no growth but the debt availed should be for creation of productive assets. Go for it if you have the financial means and a backup plan in place.

I would like to conclude with the following quotes:

‘When you borrow a lot of money to create a false prosperity, you import the future into the present’ and ‘Leverage brings you a glimpse of prosperity you haven’t really earned’.

"JAN 01 2017, 22:15 IST",Business,"Ashwini Kumar Hooda, Jan 02, 2017,","Digitisation, a key enabler in disbursing home loans","Household shopping, festive gifting, daily odd jobs, or necessary arrangements for that trip you have been planning for months – try imagining going through any of these without the help of your smartphone or your laptop.

It would be fairly accurate to predict a majority of today’s population to find themselves at odds to complete any of these tasks without the advantages that digitisation brings along with it.

Banking and financial services too have reaped the benefits that digitisation has to offer. The lending space for instance, recognised multiple areas that could be bettered. Long, tedious processes, lack of transparency and flexibility are only a few of the reasons that one could blame for inferior customer experiences.

Longer work hours and the ever reducing window to close in on your perfect home meant that missing out on visiting the housing financier could set one back immeasurably. Digitisation has made it possible for one to sit back at home and get a home loan approved within the same day.   

If we go back, say, even by a decade or so, home loan seekers would have to make multiple trips to the lenders’ offices, starting from the initiation of the loan, and through the duration of loan management. Just the approval would take anything between 20 days and a month.

Pre-empting the needs of customers in the industry, home loans providers have made everything from the loan application, to the submission of documents, to the know-your-customer (KYC) process, to loan disbursal to the seller/ builder available online.

Companies can now eliminate large amounts of paperwork. Systems to help store documents automatically and allow centralised access to different departments add crucial effectiveness. It also greatly reduces the time taken for processes thereby improving customer convenience.

Convenience is amply complemented with transparency for consumers. With greater digital support, people have more access to information. Customers earlier unaware of processes are now privy to the entire system since every step can be brought online.

The mantra for the sector now is that it must innovate at the pace of its customers. To meet this, companies have introduced mobile applications that bring the entire gamut of their services to customers with regular updates and a more fluid loan management system.

Every major shift in ideology and execution needs a champion for the cause. In this case, efforts from both the government and financers have shown the way.

Technological advancements, be it the help from National Securities Depository (NSDL) for real-time permanent account number (PAN) verification and eKYC that has helped in faster authentications, or Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) and the Centre for Development through Advanced Computing (C-DAC) for e-signing facility, and authentication using one-time password (OTP) has helped in cutting down paper and time.

While digitisation is making home loans easier and easier for customers, housing finance companies too can benefit with the creation of leaner organisational structures.

This would bring down the cost of loans for them. Computerised data collection provides better analysis of consumer behaviour, and in turn cross-selling services to customers.

Features like e-signature, which is part of the Sarfaesi Act (Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act), not only eases the customer load of processes but also provides a stronger base for loan recovery thus potentially reducing non-performing assets. The wave of digitisation has just begun and better, bigger and newer things are in works. Traditional methods will soon be replaced by digitised options only for them to be bettered by newer more efficient ways. It is an exciting time in the housing finance space.

In an industry where differentiation is key, the more customer convenience is increased, the better the company’s prospects. Digitisation thus, is the key to a sustainable future for the sector.

"JAN 01 2017, 23:25 IST",Opinion,"Jan 02, 2017, DHNS,","PM's speech, a huge letdown","There were huge expectations that Prime Minister Narendra Modi would announce the lifting of restrictions imposed on withdrawal of money from the banks and ATMs and that he would give an account of the entire exercise of demonetisation when he made a television address on new year’s eve. Instead, it was a big let down. Neither was there any report card on the 50 days of demonetisation nor was there any announcement relating to the ‘continuation of war’ on black money, such as taking on benami transactions or assets. There was no reference either to cleaning up political parties of unaccounted funds. Instead, Modi made announcements as though the finance minister was giving out sops in his budget speech in Parliament. Overall, he did not answer any question that have arisen since November 8 when he announced demonetisation. What comes at the end of such a traumatic exercise, he has not spelled out. How long will this last? There is no answer. When almost all sectors of the economy are suffering because of cash crunch, the PM made no mention of the revival of the economy, or the amount of money that has come back into the system after November 8. There was no word on how much black money and fake currency the government has unearthed.

While citizens who suffered during the last 50 days expected a sincere balance sheet in terms of neutralisation of so-called parallel economy, Modi talked in generalities without any data or empirical evidence. For instance, when he said the Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes were used less for legitimate transactions and more for “parallel economy”, the assertion should have been backed by data or a credible study. Likewise, to suggest that counterfeit currency, Maoist and terrorist activities have suffered a blow because of demonetisation cannot be a justification for such a mammoth burden inflicted on citizens and the economy by withdrawing currency to the extent of 86% in circulation.

No one would grudge the support to farmers, small businesses and the vulnerable sections of the society. In any case, it is the primary duty of any government to let these sections have the first charge on the national resources. While the interest subvention for farmers and those seeking loans for low cost and affordable homes would help these sections, there is no relationship of such measures with the note ban. The best course would have been to announce these schemes in the Budget which is just a month away. These sops, coming just before the likely announcement any time of the upcoming elections in key states, including Uttar Pradesh, is unethical."
"JAN 01 2017, 23:30 IST",Opinion,"Anindita Majumdar, Jan 02, 2017,",Fuelling change via social media activism,"It is not without reason that we are unable to discount the importance of the court of public opinion in contemporary life. This is especially true since this court now operates from multiple fora: news media, television and of course social media and social networking sites.

The intensity with which public opinion is aired and decimated through trolls and other forms of abuse and opinion-making is testimony to how we now live in the age of unreason. Multiple opinions may be aired, but are not tolerated, making discussion and debate a truly haloed practice.

But what is more important in these times of social media opinion courts, is the emerging social activism which has gone from the street to the web.

One of the most intense public demonstrations emerged from social media in December 2012 in the wake of the Delhi rape of the young trainee-physiotherapist Jyoti. The public anger garnered on the web led to an outcry on the streets becoming one of the most iconic spontaneous fights for gender-based social justice in India.

Many suggested that such a protest was the ripple effect of the Arab Spring which began in Tunisia and extended to Egypt, and also to the Occupy Wall Street protests in New York, all of which had emerged from aggressive social media activism.

The power of social media forcing a public opinion has taken different forms. Recently, during the intense fight to protect indigenous rights over land in Dakota, which was threatened with the building of a pipeline, social media activism became an important tool to get attention and support for the rights of native American Indians.

Eventually, the pipeline was cancelled by the US Army with veterans from the US Army apologising for the atrocities committed against the American Indians over many centuries. This event was played over and over again on social media and consumed by many people across the globe.

This form of consumption and public activism becomes even more important within the processes of repeated sharing of posts, videos and news report-age that travels across space and time bringing people together on shared goals and aspirations.

In the crisis of war and death that has affected Syria’s Aleppo, culminating in international media beaming through the video the plight of the five year old boy who injured and in shock—social media was alive with anxiety. That didn’t stop the war, but got the residents of Aleppo attention.

Recently, desperation and an escalation in violence led to the residents posting farewell videos on Facebook, almost screaming for help to an otherwise disenchanted remote world. Has social media displaced the real world desire to fight protest and scream? Or has social media become an active precipitator to new forms of social activism?

Many would note that the fickleness of social media activism is nothing compared to the kind of effort, time and sacrifice that goes into long-running street activism. Sharing points of dissonance and activism from the comfort of your home and in front of the computer hardly qualifies as activism in the real sense.

The history of social movements in India is testimony to the form of institutionalised torture that people have undergone to seek justice and rights. And frankly, the street protest is not gone. It exists and thrives today with even greater force.

Then what does social media do? What do we fulfil by sharing stories, news of protests or acti-vism? Most importantly, can we discount the effect of social media on activism on the streets?

Rebellion and protest

Social media began with and continues to be a space for the young and restless — perfect ingredients for rebellion and protest. Of interest will be the changes that have followed from the kind of revolt-rebellion that were part of the 1960-70s to present day social unrest. For instance, university activism today remains in essence the same but involves mass mobilisation through social media networks.

Much has been written about the influence of social networks and social media, but as we begin to become nostalgic of things that may only be a decade-old, the millenials are remaking the old into the new.

In that sense, social media is more inclusive encompassing all those who seek to be part of a movement without asking for them to participate in more public protests. That may not necessarily be an easy way out, but instead encourages people to participate and voice their involvement. ‘Armchair activism’ is not a derogatory term anymore.

The mode of rebelling has changed as we change our ways of social engagement. Whether this is in anyway superior or inferior to the old mode of ‘doing revolution’ is debatable—but the fact that social media activism fuels change and conversations cannot be discounted. This is beyond just mobilisation, but truly involves public opinion at varied levels of conversation.

Speaking at the MCC meeting here on Saturday, he said though MCC has initiated segregation of waste at source and its collection from November 1 as dry and wet, it has failed to pick up waste in all 60 wards in the city.  “Segregation of waste from source is still a problem in the city. MCC is planning to maintain bulk waste on its own rather than giving it to the Antony Waste Handling Pvt Ltd. The maintenance of bulk waste will help in generating income,” he said.

Earlier, members Mohammed, Premanand Shetty and Naveen D’Souza asked what programmes have been chalked out by the MCC for Swachh Sarvekshan survey in January. Though the survey committee has been constituted, no meetings have been convened so far, they charged.

There is a need to create awareness on cleanliness and sanitary issues at the ward level. “We are still lacking behind in our preparations,” the members said.

Environment engineer Madhu S Manohar said financial evaluation is being carried out for the proposal on the construction of e-toilets in Mangaluru.  In addition, 24 public toilets will be constructed, Manohar said.

When Shashidhar Hegde raised the issue of  foul smell emanating from dumpyard at Pacchanady has reached Yeyyadi, Shakthinagar, Kavoor and Kadri areas as well. “People are unable to bear the foul smell,” they charged.

The engineer said that a concrete road is being laid on the periphery of the compost plant at Pacchanady dump yard where, the chicken waste has been buried in a pit. As land is being excavated for laying the road, the chicken waste buried is resulting in the foul smell and it is temporary, he said.

The members also aired their grievances against Unique Waste Processing Company Ltd, the contract company of MCC, to manufacture city compost at the dumping yard. Mayor Harinath said 900 tonnes of manure is stocked at the site without any sale. The MCC is paying Rs 15 lakh to Rs 18 lakh per month to the company. The environment engineer said that after the MCC entered into an MoU with MCF for the sale of manure, the MCF has given an indent for 200 tonnes of manure.

Green cess
Member Vinayraj said there are 40 parks in MCC jurisdiction. However, there are only 18 persons to maintain the parks. Though the MCC has collected Rs 5.60 crore green cess from its citizens from 2005 to March 2016, the collected amount is not being used for expanding the greenery in the city. Instead, the amount is being diverted for other purposes. There is a need to take up plantation drive on medians, he said.

Commissioner Mohammed Nazeer said that Rs 3.78 crore collected under green cess has been transferred to other heads. “But I have directed the officials not to divert the green cess amount,” he said.

Feasibility report shortly
Nazeer said the KUIDFC will submit feasibility report on the proposed bus stand for private buses at Pumpwell, within 15 days. MCC has proposed to build a state-of-the-art bus stand on 7.21 acres of land at Pumpwell.  The feasibility report for the construction of markets at Kadri and Kankanady has been prepared by the KUIDFC and it will be placed before the Cabinet for approval shortly, he added.

Answering a journalist’s query, Rai said he was unaware of the remark made by Union Minister of State for Environment, Forest and Climate Change Anil Madhav Dave at Moodbidri on Friday that the Central government hadn’t given permission for felling of trees for the Yettinahole project. But he dared the Centre to stop the project if the Ministry of Environment and Forests hadn’t okayed it.

When journalists asked him whether the Union minister had lied about the MoEF permission, Rai evaded a direct answer and merely said, “It’s common sense that no project can be implemented without approval from the Centre.”

Stating that politicians of all parties as well as environmentalists are “misleading” people on the Yettinahole project, Rai said, “No party, which comes to power in the state, can stop the project from seeing the light of day.”

Without naming former MLA K Vijay Kumar Shetty who is leading the anti-Yettinahole movement as president of Netravathi Rakshana Samyukta Samiti and who recently criticised Rai, the minister said, “I deny whatever allegations he has made against me before the media.”

Rai said that he had arranged a meeting of local politicians with Chief Minister Siddaramaiah in Bengaluru but the participants gave contradictory statements to the media.

Accusing the BJP of “misleading” the people on the Yettinahole project to “draw political mileage”, Rai said, “It was on July 13, 2012, when the BJP was in power, that administrative approval was given to the project following submission of revised estimates.”

When asked about allegations that some minister received kickbacks to support the project, Rai said, “If anybody has committed irregularities, they must be punished.”

Speaking on the sidelines of his village stay programme organised to mark the New Year at Marli Koraga’s house in Murur village, he said the most backward and underprivileged classes of the society, which are duly considered as the primitive tribes of the Indian caste system, are struggling to fight with other castes and it calls for the reservation. Hence, there is a rising demand for the internal reservation, he said.

He asserted that the Forest Rights Act has empowered the tribal communities.They can utilise the forest resources for development. The tribal communities can sell the forest products for their living. The Forest Rights Act is the most unique and a revolutionary act which has substantially aimed at improving the livelihood of the tribal communities, he said.

Anjaneya said he has stayed at villages in Dakshina Kannada, Uttara Kannada, Chamarajnagar, Mysuru and Chikkamagaluru districts already. “I look into effective implementation of the projects already announced during the village stay,” he said.

He said transport facility is the urgent requirement for the development of any community. The development of roads is essential as it is the only way out to bring the tribals, especially the Koraga community people, into the mainstream of the society.

Blocking work
Anjaneya also expressed displeasure against the Forest Department for blocking the development works at least in the adjacent areas connecting forest.

The minister said he will not announce any additional package in Udupi as the state government has already released Rs 83 crore to the development projects of Koraga communities. In this, Rs 29 crore has been already spent on various programmes, he said.

 He also sai that he will urge the chief minister to hike the unit cost of the housing construction to Rs 4.5 lakh as against the existing Rs 2 lakh which is totally insufficient. The Koraga community people are too poor to bear the expenses and are struggling to make their livelihood, he felt.

Expressing apprehensions over the decreasing number of Koragas, the minister said the primitive tribes are slowly decreasing in numbers owing to conflicts and violence and most recently due to the superstitious beliefs.The increasing superstitious beliefs have resulted in decrease in the number of Koragas. Infusing scientific thinking among Koragas is the need of the hour, he said.

Anjaneya stressed that educational and socioeconomic empowerment of the tribals. He said third party inspection will be conducted for the reimbursement of medical bills issued by the recognised hospitals by the government following charges against the fraud done in the bills by the hospitals.

Earlier, he was given a rousing welcome in a traditional way by the Koraga community people. They welcomed him with the traditional band and dance. He was also offered ‘Hale Toppi’ and was also given the various forest grown fruits. He was also offered the ‘Gajje Kolu’ representing Koragajja, the deity of the Koraga community.

The activists have reasoned that the increasing number of tourist numbers is also one of the reasons for pollution of the water body at its source of origin in the district. Hence, a new elephant camp should be started near Chiklihole reservoir and Dubare Elephant Camp should be linked by a hanging bridge, they said.

‘Remove buildings’
The buildings on riverbeds coming under Kushalnagar Town Panchayat jurisdiction should be removed and measures should be taken to develop the same land as a lung space by planting saplings. Dry pits should be constructed to check the flow of waste and sewage into river Cauvery, till underground drainage works are completed, they demanded.

Stating that Cauvery river continues to be polluted at its place of birth, the activists said waste and sewage water from nearby towns and villages are reaching the water body and hence, it is in a pathetic state. The mushrooming of vendors at tourist spots producing waste is yet another reason for the waterbody

The waste generated from Tala Cauvery, Bhagamandala, Bengur, Kundachery, Napoklu, Ballamavaty, Parane, Hoddur and Moornadu villages are directly joining the river. Further damage to the river can be stopped with the setting up of drinking water units, construction of community toilets with better maintenance, especially in Bhagamandala limits, arranging vehicles to collect and dispose of waste and also construct underground drainages as a permanent solution to the menace.

The activists have identified Kakotu Prambu and Bhetri in Nelli Hudikeri village as the epicentre of pollution, where the sewage is getting mixed with river exactly. It can be addressed by evicting over 70 dwellings on riverbed. Similarly, over 80 houses are situated on the riverbed at Halugunda and 30 at Kannangala village, followed by over 200 houses at Siddapura.

‘Awareness needed’
Apart from creating measures, awareness should be created among the people, including vendors. Community toilets should be built at markets and measures should be taken for disposal of chicken waste, they demanded.

The waste generated at places of tourist interest at Nelli Hudikeri, Valnur, Thagathur, Nanjarayapattana, Dubare, Gudde Hosur, Mullusoge, Thorenur and Shirangala in Somwarpet taluk and Dubare in Nanjarayapattana and Kaveri Nisargadhama near Guddehosur coming under Kushalnagar Town Panchayat limits is yet another reason.

The private agency had surveyed the region identified for the construction of road on the Bhairapura-Shishila route in the Baluru reserved forest.

The staff of the above mentioned private firm had illegally infiltrated into the reserve forest, conducted a GPS-based survey and marked the rocks inside the forest with colour, said a complaint filed on the basis of the observations made by the forest guards. The Conservator of Forests, Prahlad, has registered the complaint.

The state government has been consistently trying to construct a road on the Bhairapura-Shishila route and every possible ‘hurdle’ is being cleared by the government. M S Manik, the district Deputy Conservator of Forests who had submitted a report against the construction of the road, has been transferred to Shivamogga circle. Manik is succeeded by an official who is an associate of an influential minister, so that the work on the road may continue, say both environmentalists and sources in the Forest Department.

Manik, in his report submitted in September, had mentioned that the construction of the road on the Bhairapura-Shishila route is not recommended as the region receives 7,500 mm to 9,000 mm annual rainfall and comprises evergreen forests, shola forests and also the deemed forest. The construction of roads will cause an obstacle to elephant and tiger corridors, said the report.

Earlier, the government had directed M S Manik through a final notice served on August 19 that a clear-cut opinion may be given after carrying out a survey of the place by spot inspections.

The proposed road has been vehemently opposed by environmentalists. There has also been speculation over some lobbies batting for the road construction.

"JAN 01 2017, 11:46 IST",Archives,"London, Jan 1, 2016, PTI,",'Friendship Bench' may help fight mental illness,"Friendship Benches - simple wooden seats with trained community ""grandmothers"" who listen to and support people living with anxiety, depression and other common mental disorders can improve the lives of millions of patients in developing countries, a new study has found.

Six months after undergoing six weekly ""problem solving therapy"" sessions on the Friendship Benches located at health clinics in major cities in Zimbabwe, participants showed significant differences in severity of depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts.

The practitioners were lay health workers known as community ""grandmothers"" who were trained to support people with common mental disorders.

The innovative approach holds the potential to significantly improve the lives of millions of people with moderate and severe mental health problems in countries where access to treatment is limited or nonexistent, researchers said.

Patients with depression or anxiety who received problem-solving therapy through the Friendship Bench were more than three times less likely to have symptoms of depression after six months, compared to patients who received standard care, according to the researchers from University of Zimbabwe, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and King's College London.

Patients were also four times less likely to have anxiety symptoms and five times less likely to have suicidal thoughts than the control group after follow-up.

Fifty per cent of patients who received standard care still had symptoms of depression compared to 14 per cent who received Friendship Bench.

About 48 per cent of patients who received standard care still had symptoms of anxiety compared to 12 per cent who received Friendship Bench, and 12 per cent of patients who received standard care still had suicidal thoughts compared to two per cent who received Friendship Bench.

The Friendship Bench intervention was also shown to be well suited to improve health outcomes among highly vulnerable individuals.

About 86 per cent of the study's participants were women, over 40 per cent were HIV positive, and 70 per cent had experienced domestic violence or physical illness.

Dixon Chibanda, a consultant psychiatrist, co-founded the Friendship Bench network in response to the appalling shortage of evidence-based treatment for people with mental disorders in Zimbabwe, a problem common throughout Africa.

While about 25 per cent of the country's primary care patients suffer from depression, anxiety and other common mental disorders, Zimbabwe (population 15 million) has only 10 psychiatrists and 15 clinical psychologists.

"JAN 01 2017, 15:02 IST",Archives,"New York, Jan 1, 2017 (PTI),",Why obese people can't stick to gym programmes decoded,"Obese people may have altered dopamine receptors, causing them to have little motivation to exercise, according to a new study which may explain why some overweight people find it difficult to stick to exercise programmes. Researchers from the US National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) fed the mice either a standard or a high-fat diet for 18 weeks.

Beginning in the second week, the mice on the unhealthy diet had higher body weight. By the fourth week, these mice spent less time moving and got around much more slowly when they did move. Mice on high-fat diet moved less before they gained the majority of the weight, suggesting that the excess weight alone was not responsible for the reduced movements.

The researchers looked at six different components in the dopamine signalling pathway and found that the obese, inactive mice had deficits in the D2 dopamine receptor. ""There are probably other factors involved as well, but the deficit in D2 is sufficient to explain the lack of activity,"" said Danielle Friend, a postdoctoral fellow at NIDDK.

""We know that physical activity is linked to overall good health, but not much is known about why people or animals with obesity are less active,"" said Alexxai V Kravitz from NIDDK. ""There is a common belief that obese animals do not move as much because carrying extra body weight is physically disabling. But our findings suggest that assumption does not explain the whole story,"" said Kravitz.

He hypothesised that the reason the mice were inactive was due to dysfunction in their dopamine systems. ""Other studies have connected dopamine signalling defects to obesity, but most of them have looked at reward processing - how animals feel when they eat different foods,"" said Kravitz. The team also studied the connection between inactivity and weight gain, to determine if it was causative.

By studying lean mice that were engineered to have the same defect in the D2 receptor, they found that those mice did not gain weight more readily on a high-fat diet, despite their lack of inactivity, suggesting that weight gain was compounded once the mice start moving less. ""In many cases, willpower is invoked as a way to modify behaviour,"" said Kravitz.

""However if we do not understand the underlying physical basis for that behaviour, it is difficult to say that willpower alone can solve it,"" he said. If we begin to decipher the physiological causes for why people with obesity are less active, it may also help reduce some of the stigma that they face, researchers said. The study was published in the journal Cell Metabolism."

"JAN 01 2017, 23:28 IST",Opinion,"Alok Ray, Jan 02, 2017,",Hoping for better days,"Economists are reasonably good at explaining what has already happened. But they are bad at forecasting. So, standing at the beginning of 2017, we would mostly focus on some of the major developments in the global and the Indian economy that took place in the last calendar year while taking some risky guesses about the future.

Two biggest developments in the global economy in 2016 were Britain’s exit from the European Union by popular referendum, and the election of Donald Trump as the president of USA – both events contrary to most pollsters’ predictions (economists are not the only bad forecasters!).

Despite dire predictions, the British economy is not yet worse off after the decision. The British pound plummeted but  it stimulated British exports while the fear of  Britain losing the benefits of the European Common Market is inducing some firms (like the Tata Steel) to sell or move part of  their operations to other parts of EU.

Trump’s win has introduced the greatest element of uncertainty in the global policy space. The casual and conflicting messages about economic and geo-political policy directions thrown up by Trump have kept all countries – both traditional allies and adversaries – guessing. But, as things stand now, it seems that domestically he would go for tax cuts for the rich and the business class while spending more on infrastructure. Both would lead to bigger fiscal deficit which, however, is against the typical Republican philosophy.

Fed has recently raised the policy rate by another 0.25% while hinting at further rate hikes in 2017. So, the expansionary fiscal policy of Trump may well be offset to some extent by tighter monetary policy. If, on balance, the US economy continues to expand (in fact, US is the only developed economy which is showing solid recovery, unlike EU and Japan), it is good news for the rest of the world.

Higher growth of demand as well as a rising dollar (specially if Fed continues to increase interest rate) would mean more exports by the rest of the world, providing a growth stimulus.

On the other hand, because of the higher interest rate in US and rising dollar, the emerging economies like India and China would suffer the consequences of capital outflows, pushing down the value of their currencies, fuelling imported inflation. All these at a time when global crude oil prices have doubled over the year (from $27 in February 2016 to $54 a barrel now)  as a result of both Opec (Organisation of Oil Exporting Countries) and non-Opec countries finally able to work out a production curtailing agreement.

This is bad news for oil importing countries like India and good news for diverse oil exporting countries. New Delhi would benefit to the extent some of the Gulf countries’ higher oil revenue creates jobs for expatriate Indians leading to higher remittances back home.

China’s growth rate has officially come down to around 6.5%. Even if the Indian growth rate loses, say 1 percentage point due to the adverse short-term effects of demonetisation, it is likely that India would continue to surpass China as the fastest growing big economy in the world. It is also likely that after a dip for a couple of quarters due to the liquidity crisis created by demonetisation, the postponed demand would get reflected in a higher GDP growth after some six months or so.

Though, after the win of Trump, the  US-led Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) is dead, it provides China a good opportunity to fill the vacuum in Asia by trying to forge a mega trading bloc which would include China, Japan, South Korea,  the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) and India while excluding the US. It thus gives China another leeway to erode USA’s leadership in global economic affairs. The mutual benefits of globalisation, though increasingly questioned in the USA and Europe, are not yet lost in the Asian countries.

Low energy prices

Inflation, as measured by the CPI, is currently below 4% in India while the WPI inflation is even lower. This is largely due to the exceptionally low energy prices and good monsoon.

The phase of low energy prices is getting over, though it is highly unlikely to go above $60 per barrel as any price higher than this is going to bring about a flood of shale oil to the market. So, oil price-induced inflation should be limited. However, the introduction of GST (whenever it is launched) may lead to a one-shot rise in prices.
The squeezing of liquidity from the informal into the formal banking system, following demonetisation, has made banks flush with funds on which they have to pay interest while they cannot find enough credit worthy borrowers.

Apart from reducing deposit and lending rates, these developments are making life difficult for banks already saddled with bad debts. The Fed interest rate hike, however, makes the RBI more cautious to reduce rates, as it increases the risk of triggering further capital outflows, falling rupee and rising inflation.

The fear of scrutinising bank transactions, income tax raids and prosecution - following demonetisation - would certainly induce more tax payments under the voluntary schemes and would increase declared income in tax returns.

Also, the introduction of GST would force business people to insist on purchase receipts on inputs in order to claim tax credits on sales. This is apart from the improvement in RBI balance sheet as some old notes may not come back to the system. Whether that would increase RBI profits or go to the government as higher dividends is not clear at this point.

As higher tax revenue is spent on infrastructure and pro-poor programmes, the negative sentiment surrounding the massive demonetisation experiment may yield to more positive ones, specially if some high profile people are successfully prosecuted and tax rates come down for most people. Apart from the medium-term economic gains justifying the immediate hardships, this may well  be a political plus for the Modi government in 2019 Parliament elections.

"JAN 01 2017, 20:57 IST",Metrolife,"Rajitha Menon, Jan 02, 2017, DHNS,",Spinning new tales,"It was a night of revelry for many party goers in the city who danced their hearts out till the wee hours of the morning and welcomed the new year in a fun-filled celebration.

Ecstatic screams and frenzied moves were heightened by the electrifying music being churned out from the turntables by the DJs; those heralds of thrill and zest. They add life to any party but their own lives are far from the picture-perfect versions we see on screen.

“I have been in the industry for 21 years now,” says DJ Clitus, one of the pioneers of the club scene in Bengaluru. “Till the early 2000s, we were seen as artistes and treated on par with musicians but after that, the nature of the profession changed. It became highly commercialised. A lot of constraints were imposed on what we could and should play; we were asked to stick to songs that the crowd knew. We lost the freedom to play our own tracks,” he rues.

DJ Rajesh agrees. “The nature of the challenges we face has changed but they never really go away. Earlier, DJing was not accepted as a profession. In fact, there was a huge confusion between DJs and bands; after all, both created music. I had to go around explaining to people what I did. But now people have understood this profession and demand has increased exponentially. With that, it has become a state of ‘survival of the fittest’. You have to be constantly updated, even if you are not actively playing anywhere.”

He goes on to add, “The politics in the field is another issue along with the kind of attitude that we sometimes have to deal with. Some members in the crowd, both in clubs and at private parties, have this feeling that since I am paying for the DJ, he has to do my bidding. They come and bug you to play songs of their liking — again and again.”

Many DJs feel that the business aspect of this profession is eclipsing the real reason they chose to enter this field in the first place —  a love for music. “Whenever you go to a club, rather than asking what kind of music you play, the first thing they ask is ‘how many people can you get?’,” says DJ Sachin. “I understand it is important for them. But for a DJ to be a crowd puller, they need to know what exactly will get the crowd going; the songs, the beats, the grooves and so on. For that, you need to practice in a club. But clubs are reluctant to give chances to newbies,” he says.

Health is one of the main sacrifices that people in this profession make. Erratic sleep patterns, lifestyle choices, extended shifts — all these combine to ensure that DJs have to be extra aware of their fitness. “We work as per US timings,” laughs Clitus. “I used to work (or party, if you will) till 6 in the morning and then sleep till 4-5 pm. To counter the ill effects, I make sure to eat only one meal a day and drink a lot of water, even to this day. I am also a non-drinker, something that most people find very hard to believe,” he says.

“There are many misconceptions about the lifestyles of DJs among people,” says Rajesh. “A lot of people think that we do drugs or sit around smoking or drinking. These are not prerequisites to becoming a DJ; lifestyle choices depend from person to person and should not be associated with a profession. I myself know many DJs who are non-smokers and non-drinkers. But people are not willing to accept that we can be this way too.” With the increasing popularity of this profession comes an increasing number of people dependent on technology instead of talent. “Every kid with a controller can be a DJ now,” says Sachin. “They just push a few buttons and mix and mash a few tracks. There is no originality, no love for music.”

“The young and upcoming DJs have it easy,” agrees Jayaram Sharma aka JayZ. “There is not much effort and creativity in the process. Most of them don’t even know the basics nowadays; they depend on social media or YouTube to create a name for themselves. Marketing is more, music is less.”"
"JAN 01 2017, 21:00 IST",Metrolife,"Nina C George, Jan 02, 2017, DHNS,",'I don't believe in restricting myself',"Actor Dhananjaya believes in taking risks, big or small. He thinks only experiments will lead to progress and help him grow as an actor.

This approach, he firmly believes, will prepare and take him to the next level. This thought is clearly visible in his choice of films,  whether it is ‘Rhaatee’, ‘Boxer’,‘Badmaash’ or ‘Tagaru’, the actor has made concerted efforts to weed out repetition. The coming year looks good for Dhananjaya with ‘Allama’ almost ready for release and a couple more projects that he is working on. In an interview with Nina C George, the actor talks about why he is choosy with work.

Why do you think ‘Allama’ is different?

‘Allama’ is the biopic of 12th-century mystic-saint Allama Prabhu. I would say that this is by far the best project that  have worked on. I was handed over the script of ‘Allama’ a month before the actual shooting began. This gave me enough time to study the character and read about him, to understand what made him one among the most sought-after saints of his time. I also sat through some lessons in mridangam because Allama was a master at playing the instrument.

Did working on ‘Allama’ take you back to your theatre days?

Yes it did. The lengthy dialogues, flamboyant costumes and subtlety of the character did take me to my days in theatre.  I always felt like I was transported to a different world whenever I was shooting for ‘Allama’.  

What’s your role in ‘Eradane Sala’?

The film is directed by Guruprasad and it was his idea that I play the character of a flirt. The film delves into the emotions at play between a mother and son. It also looks at what happens when a woman enters the son’s life. It deals with a lot of issues that are seen cropping up in an urban setting, especially in nuclear families. It’s a very raw story and people will get to see the mischievous side of me.

What do you think is the strength of ‘Eradane Sala’?

The film explores real issues such as insecurities, love and what happens when one has too much expectations. It is relevant to the present times where the hard side of reality is narrated in a hilarious way.

What made you accept ‘Tagaru’?

 This is the first time that I was offered to play a villain in ‘Tagaru’ and it was hard to decline the offer. A lot of people wondered how I would be able to carry off a negative role but I was eager to take up the challenge. I don't believe in restricting myself. And the chance of acting alongside Shivarajkumar was another aspect that got me to sign on the dotted line. My character looks very interesting because I am not allowed to talk too much, my actions speak more. We also have a stylist working on giving me a look that suits my character.

Do you wish to venture into direction someday?

The stage has always been a part of my life and growing up years. The short film, ‘Jayanagar 4th Block’ was written by me and it gave me a good start. I want to get into direction someday but it’s too early to talk about it.  I have too much on my hands."
"JAN 01 2017, 21:02 IST",Metrolife,"Jan 02, 2017, DHNS,",'The only thing to do now is to keep evolving',"Bollywood star Priyanka Chopra says when she chose to explore acting opportunities in the West, her only worry was whether she would be able to make a name for herself in Hollywood.

Priyanka, 34, earned global fame after starring in hit American TV show ‘Quantico’.
She has since made appearances on popular talk shows, graced top magazine covers, walked red carpets at award shows across America and was also present at the White House Correspondents’ dinner hosted by outgoing US President Barack Obama.

“My worry (in the US), as an Indian actor, was whether the global entertainment industry was ready to see an Indian actor in the lead, as we haven’t seen one before — be it in television or films. I was worried about it as it had not happened with any Indian actor,” Priyanka said.

“My worry was ‘Will I be good enough?’ But I had such a wonderful reception. I have got so much love and affection. The only thing to do now is to keep evolving. I only think about how I can grow more and what more can I do.”

Priyanka entered the Hindi film industry after winning the Miss World title in 2000. She made a mark in Bollywood with films like ‘Aitraaz’, ‘Fashion’, ‘Barfi’, ‘Mary Kom’ and ‘Bajirao Mastani’ among others and then turned to Hollywood to explore acting opportunities there.

She made her acting debut in Hollywood with American television show ‘Quantico’ and is also part of the ‘Baywatch’ film which will release next year.

“When I was going to another country (US), I was not worried about acting as I know my job well. I know the technical aspects, I have tremendous experience of working with incredible filmmakers who have taught me my job,” she says.

“I can stand on the world stage and be confident about my work as my training was with the most prolific film industry in the world which is the Hindi film industry.”"
"JAN 01 2017, 21:05 IST",Metrolife,"Tini Sara Anien, Jan 02, 2017, DHNS,",Young talent on the rise,"There’s much expected for the year ahead, be it in the field of fashion, music industry or films.

With arts growing by leaps and bounds, an industry that saw a lot of transformation was our own vibrant Sandalwood, which saw a lot of refreshing scripts in 2016. Raising its own bar, young artistes in the industry speak about the possibilities they see for themselves and the industry in the year ahead. 

Actors in the industry who got a big boost this year with their projects are expecting the industry to change for the better. Iti Acharya, a young actor who was seen in projects like ‘Deal Raja’ and ‘Badmaash’, will be seen in ‘Dhwani’ in 2017.

“Realistic cinema is the trend of the times and 2017 is definitely going to welcome projects which are inspired from incidents around us. More and more movies that will include slices of life inspired from our own lives and around, will be seen on the silver screen,” voices Iti.

Iti adds that though she was reluctant to act in ‘Dhwani’ initially, she understood that ‘close to life’ subjects will be the trend in the industry soon for the years ahead.

Yash Shetty who was seen in ‘John Jani Janardhan’ and ‘Sojiga’ this year, feels that 2017 will see a big shift in growth of all genres and characters. “I have been seen in variations of many villainous roles and I wish to explore much more through all the roles. After the release of ‘John Jani Janardhan’, I have been offered many roles and I see the year ahead to be a very encouraging one for all young artistes,” he says. Yash feels that the industry is opening to different characterisation, which seems promising.

Actor Anup Revanna who was seen in ‘Lakshmana’ this year, says that the past years have proved that experimentation is the norm of the day. “The industry has seen new movies which were accepted, appreciated and also made money. This is a big thing. Movies like ‘Godhi Banna Sadharana Mykattu’, ‘Tithi’ and ‘U-Turn’ have done well. This is good for filmmakers and the artistes. This trend will continue to burgeon in 2017.”

Anup who will be seen in ‘Raja Ratha’ next year and who has co-written a script which will be directed by Rishab Shetty, is hopeful that the year ahead will see content which is interesting and a continuing audience for the same. “There is a bridging of  all sections of the audience in projects nowadays, which is important.”

The apprehension of hiring fresh talent is fading away in the industry, says actor Purvi Joshi. “This year is the time for young actors to be here. It’s no more about the faces but more about the characters that are being portrayed in each project now,” she says. 

People are willing to watch Kannada movies and are opening up to the idea of experimenting. Purvi who will be seen in ‘BMW’ and ‘Raja Hamsa’ feels, “The changing storyline and the technicalities are adding to the uniqueness of all the projects and this will only increase in 2017.”

Sandalwood has gone through a bout of changes and young actors like Rajvardhan Dingri, son of veteran actor Dingri Nagaraj, feels that the year ahead will be a great one to mark his niche.

“My projects ‘Fly’, ‘Noorondu Nenappu’ and ‘Ira’ are bound for a 2017 release. While ‘Fly’ is a romantic movie, ‘Noorondu...’ will see me in a rugged 80s look and in ‘Ira’ I play a posh character. Variety is the spice of life and this will be the theme of the industry itself in the coming year,” feels Rajvardhan.

He says that with the advent of new scripts and storylines, the industry will see a lot of growth and experimentation in terms of characters and stories too. “This will be my year!” he adds with a smile."
"JAN 01 2017, 21:08 IST",Metrolife,"Surupasree Sarmmah, Jan 02, 2017, DHNS,",'There is always room for learning',"What started as a hobby has now shaped into a much sought-after design label among fashionistas. Asif Merchant took his first step into the fashion industry 25 years ago and has never failed to impress with every collection he intricately works on, ever since.

From helping his sister with stitching and bringing out a new design during his college days to working for an Italian fashion house that caters to big brands, Asif has seen and done it all. In a chat with Surupasree Sarmmah, the passionate designer talks about his most creative design, his love for travelling and his inspiration.

How did fashion designing happen?

I was an engineering student, but somewhere within, I was always inclined towards the intricacies of designing. My sister was into stitching and creating garments; there were times when I used to lend her a helping hand and would design outfits whenever I got time. And before I knew it, this passion turned into a profession and I started my own label in 1995.

If not a designer...

I would have been a part of a flight crew for sure. I love travelling and this profession would have given me an opportunity to visit different places (laughs).
One of your most creative ensembles...

I remember making a range of gowns with electronic wastes, wires, locks and keys, wrapping papers and chains. I made embroidery out of them on the gowns; it was something which was challenging yet quite interesting. I would say it was one of the most out-of-the-box ideas.

Your latest collection looks very poised...

I have concentrated on the red carpet look for both men and women. Apart from which resort wear and ready-to-party outfits are prominent too. Gowns for women and power-dressing like tuxedos and suits for men, which have a classic royal look, are the highlight.

The three must-haves in your winter wardrobe...

A trench coat, mufflers and scarves and a bag that I dedicatedly carry with me during all seasons.

What inspires your creations?

I get most of my inspiration from nature and my travels. Nature plays a big role in helping me with ideas for colours, designs and even the textures for an outfit. Apart from that, meeting new people from around the world and learning about their culture is inspiring too.

Your favourite fabrics to work with...

I like flowy fabrics. Georgette and natural, organic fabrics top my list. I love working with colours like white and blue.

Anyone you want to dress up from the film industry?

I would love to work with Sonam Kapoor. She has everything that a designer looks for — the right attitude, grace and the fact that she gives life to an outfit.

What is your mantra during a crisis situation backstage?

Be calm and cool. This way the mind will work more wisely. I handle the situation with love and care and don’t believe in raising my temper with anyone.

An advice that changed your life...

My father’s advice, ‘Be yourself’, has helped me look at life differently.

A word for aspiring designers...
Have patience and remember that ‘Rome was not built in a day’. Don’t miss a chance to learn from others. Even after being in the industry for 25 years, there are times when I still get to learn something new from my juniors. There is always room for learning."
"JAN 01 2017, 21:11 IST",Metrolife,"Anila Kurian, Jan 02, 2017, DHNS,",'It has been a crazy journey',"It made a world of difference for Silva Storai when she moved from Italy to India a couple of decades ago.

The karmic connection brought her to Kodaikanal where she met her husband. Soon enough, her love for speed motivated her to pursue her passion for horse racing.

She shifted her base to Bengaluru and there has been no looking back for her since then. She acquired the stature of becoming India’s only professional woman jockey and the only woman to have won two Derbys.

Today, she is the director of the Embassy International Riding School and is thrilled to be sharing her love for horses with the younger generation. Silva speaks to Anila Kurian about how she became the top woman in a male-dominated field.

Tell us about your initial struggles in this field.
It was a tough ride to reach where I am now, especially because I am a woman. Somehow that made people doubt my skills. But I had great friends and an instructor who taught me to overcome these beliefs. The only way to do so was to prove my talent.

Your best race so far?

I have so many of them but the most memorable one was winning my first derby. When you’re in a race, you don’t think about the title that you’re winning. Every race is the same and your adrenaline is always at its peak. But when you do win, especially the first derby of your career, it lifts you up in an incredible way. The applause and the appreciation you get show the combination of your hard work and talent.

What’s the first thing you do after the race is over?

Apart from enjoying the moment, I look forward to coming back home and relaxing. Having spent an exhaustive day, unwinding and hanging out with close ones is what I prefer to do.

One thing people tend to ignore about horse racing.

Due to ignorance, many forget to think about the horse they are riding with. They enjoy the riding much better. But it’s important that you connect with your horse and build a relationship with them. The good horsemanship will automatically make your race better.

And how can one connect with their horse?

It takes a lot of time and experience. If you’re lucky, a good instructor will also be the key to building that relationship.

Your opinion about the Derby fashion.

It’s great fun to see people dressed in different colours  on the day of the race. Though the fashion has nothing to do with the actual racing, it is nice to celebrate in a colourful way. I think it is very healthy.

Horsemanship in younger generations...

It’s great that parents are enrolling their children
for classes. I am happy to be a part of this changing lifestyle and I hope to
take horse racing to the next level.

Your other passions...

Horses are my only passion. My day revolves around them. When I’m not with them... well, I am always with them!

After living here for decades now, do you accept that you have become a
Bengalurean?

Oh yes, I think of Bengaluru as my home more than I do of Florence, Italy. I’ve seen what the city used to be like and how much it has grown. It’s been a crazy journey."
"JAN 01 2017, 21:14 IST",Metrolife,"Surupasree Sarmmah, Jan 02, 2017, DHNS,",Value for money,"Ever wondered how and where the balance on your mobile phone disappears within just a few days of recharging? Even while you talk for just a minute or two and keep the mobile data off when not in use,  you mostly end up having insufficient balance on your phone.

Stepping in as a saviour, to help prepaid mobile users keep a track on their prepaid pack balances and data usage, is ‘Mubble’, an Android application. Launched in 2015 by Ashwin Ramaswamy, Pranav Jha and Raghvendra Varma, the app seems to have become  a must-have now.

“Somewhere back in 2014, my co-founders and I were having a discussion on what is the common thread that binds everyone together in India.  Apart from cricket and Bollywood, we came to a common conclusion that a prepaid mobile phone connection is something that is used by a large number of people across the country.

This discussion led us to talk to many prepaid users and find out how they deal with problems like going low on balance within a few days of recharging, awareness about which plans to use and other things. We wanted to solve this issue by enabling consumers to track and automatically update their prepaid pack balances, monitor and save a history of their pack deductions and mobile data usage, get alarms on pack expiry, know about call rate changes and receive recommendations on best packs,” explains Ashwin.

He highlights that while there are apps like ‘FreeCharge’ and ‘Paytm’ which have already solved the issue of people stepping out to pay their mobile bills, the idea of this venture was heading to another level altogether.

“Mobile data is used even if a person is not using their phone and it’s locked. Many don’t realise but the data usage gets exhausted even in this way.  And for a prepaid user, this can be a huge issue. Another idea behind launching the app in the market was to break the notion that prepaid connections are only for blue-collar people. It is not really an issue pertaining to the income category one belongs to, it has more to do with the user’s mindset to control his usage,” says Ashwin.

‘Mubble’ helps by notifying one about pack expiry and call rate changes, giving recommendations on best packs to recharge with and enabling them to recharge through the app. It allows users to have complete control of their SIMs. The team is presently operational only in India and is focussing on serving the needs of the Indian user. However, they have enquiries pouring in from various countries like Brazil, Nigeria and Indonesia, informs Ashwin.

So what are the challenges that the team has faced over the past one year of its launch? “The long-term challenge is hiring the right kind of people to build an organisation. Another challenge which is more recent is the economic shift which has made the pricing very irrational,” says Ashwin.

As a team, ‘Mubble’ is planning on getting a larger user base and working more closely with its users. “We would like to understand our consumers’ needs and implement those changes in the venture in the near future,” he states."
"JAN 01 2017, 21:23 IST",Metrolife,"Nina C George, Jan 02, 2017, DHNS,",In a league of its own,"The designers at ‘Allen Solly’ strive to work towards eliminating repetition and monotony in their designs. Every new collection that hit the stands has its own character. The latest line of workwear for women from ‘Solly’ by Allen Solly reflects the spirit and vibrant lifestyle of the modern woman. 

A colourful twist

The first thing that grabs your attention about the latest collection is the fit and the colours used to lend a unique twist to every garment.

Vandana Gupta, Head of Design — Allen Solly — Woman and Juniors at Madura Fashion and Lifestyle, says that the inspiration behind the latest line for women comes from the tailoring of the 60’s and 70’s. “We have interpreted the past in a modern way by combining bohemian floral prints with contemporary work casuals,” says Vandana.     She points out that the designers have attempted to redefine workwear in their latest collection.

“We wanted to introduce a trend which would have different ways of dressing to work. Dressing up to office should be just as exciting as dressing for dinner or a night out.   We’ve introduced two lines — contemporary workwear and work casuals,” says Vandana. She adds that the designers have tried to strike the right balance between style and comfort without comprising on the overall look of the garment. Vandana says that most working women look for a blend of comfort and style when they shop for workwear.

“Women who are working have become very conscious about what they wear and how they present themselves at their work spaces. Well-fitted trousers, a tailored blazer and pop of colour through a fluid work shirt paired with stylish comfortable loafers —this best sums up the style quotient of the women of today,” adds Vandana.   

Matching two pieces

in an attempt to achieve a distinct look may not be an option all the time. “The key to balance your look is to select one statement piece which could be anything from a coloured blazer, bold print or statement shoe and then working out other neutral pieces around it,” explains Vandana.  

In addition to stocking some interesting designs, the brand also has an attractive range of bags and shoes in vibrant colours that are suitable for every occasion. “The market is flooded with all types of accessories. We stock the same accessories but we play around with colours to offer something unique,” says Vandana.

"JAN 01 2017, 21:26 IST",Metrolife,"M H R Rao, Jan 02, 2017,",In a walker's paradise,"This picture was taken in Bengaluru in 1947 at Central College Hostel during the annual hostel day celebration. I have very fond memories of time spent in this prestigious institution.

There were two colleges — one, the intermediate college, now known as science college, and the other, Central College across the road. This was the only science college in the state those days. They were under the administration of Mysore University. All students in the erstwhile princely state of Mysore pursuing science subjects, joined this prestigious institution.  The inspiring professors and lecturers, with their immaculate attire and immense knowledge, created an aura within the campus.                                                                                                                           
The hostel for the students was located across the road on the campus and was under the direct supervision of the principal of the college. A senior professor of the college was appointed the warden of the hostel.

He administered the management of the hostel with the assistance of prefects elected by the boarders. He was housed within the premises of the hostel.                                                                                                                                                        
I did my schooling in Kolar Gold Felds of M/s John Tylor and Sons,  where my father worked as a cashier in the security department of the company. I joined the Intermediate College in the year 1942, in the beginning of the year of Freedom movement.

Bengaluru was very different in those days. It was very calm with only a few cars on the road. Those few vehicles belonged to the state and were rarely seen on the road. I have known most of the top ranking officers of the state cycling to their  office.

There were also a few rickety buses on the road. Almost every other person either walked or cycled in the city. The city was almost dead after dark.

The Central College hostel was a prestigious student’s hostel of that time. I was a boarder till I passed out in the year 1948.  There were two blocks in  the imposing structure. The food was good and service excellent.

A very high level of discipline was maintained due to the constant monitoring and visits from the warden.

The bill of the hostel came to about Rs 50 to Rs 60 a month, after providing early morning coffee, sumptuous breakfast, unlimited lunch and dinner, afternoon snacks and coffee topped with fruit and milk at night. 

During our time Dr Sanjeeva Rao, the principal of the college, was also the official head of the hostel and Prof S B Bondade  was the warden of the hostel.

Life in the hostel was comfortable and provided a good opportunity and atmosphere for studying. Most of the time, we walked around the city and I remember walking with friends in the evening from Avenue Road to MTR. It was then housed in a small building on the road leading from Minerva Circle to Lalbagh. Another popular place that was famous for its food was Udupi Krishna Bhavan on Balepet Road.

Some of us liked English movies and they were screened only in the Bangalore Cantonment area. It was far away from the hostel and we would cycle the distance through the Cubbon Park.

Those days even cycles were required to possess a licence issued by the civic
authority. Double riding was an offence. The cycle needed  to have lights for night riding. The only source was oil lamps. We were always worried that it would extinguish and get us into trouble with the police in the cantonment area.

We used to constantly feel the top of the lamp to make sure it was always lit.
Those were the days of freedom movement. There were frequent disturbances with someone or the other holding a meeting on campus.

The classes had to be suspended. I recall the names of a few of the important leaders who lead the movement.

They were G P Krishna Rao, M S Krishnan, Vasanthiah and Dayananda Sagar. I remember the college was even closed for some time during this movement; leading to us losing one year in the Intermediate College. 

At last, while I was in my first year of BSc in 1947, we achieved our Independence and freedom and I heard the great midnight speech of our first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru on 15 August, 1947.

I completed my education and joined the services of the gold mines as a mining probationer and took over as Technical Director and officiating CMD of the company before retiring in 1983.

The once famous Central College hostel now looks dilapidated and the notice board says it houses some of the offices of the education department. I am 92 years old now and everytime I pass that way, it brings back some great memories.

"JAN 01 2017, 21:28 IST",Metrolife,"Jan 02, 2017, DHNS,",Food for thought,"Actor Salman Khan says he likes to live a healthy lifestyle and tries to stick to a balanced diet.

The star, who turned a year older recently, launched his personal app to stay in touch with his fans and spoke about his workout regime.

“I cycle, swim, go to the gym, eat the right kind of food, and sleep late, as I don’t get sleep easily. The kind of food you eat is as important as your workout. I like leading a healthy lifestyle, and avoid processed and sugary food,” says Salman.

The ‘Sultan’ star says his diet is high in protein and yellow ‘dal’ cooked by his mother is his all time favourite.

“My all-time favourite will remain the yellow ‘dal’ that my mother cooks. My favourite dishes include ‘rajma’, ‘chawal’, and ‘roti’, very simple food.

“As far as my diet is concerned, for breakfast, I eat four egg whites and some low-fat milk. Pre-workout, I have a protein shake, and two egg whites. Post workout, it is a protein bar, oats, almonds and three egg-whites. Lunch is largely meat, and includes mutton, fried fish, salad and lots of fruit. Dinner could be anything — chicken, fish, vegetables, or soup.”

Salman is known for starting the trend of having a fit physique and the actor says he religiously workouts to maintain a healthy body.

“I work out daily and follow a disciplined regime that consists of weight training and cardio. I usually focus on only few body parts — biceps, triceps, abs, legs and back. I can do multiple sit-ups, push-ups or crunches at a time.”"
"JAN 01 2017, 21:37 IST",Metrolife,"Rajitha Menon, Jan 02, 2017, DHNS,",In a world of her own,"Her sweet voice and shy demeanour are what strike you first. Cocooned in her small world, Monica Agrahara Hanumaiah rarely ventures out to meet new people. She would rather spend time pursuing her favourite hobby- origami.

A student of Visveswarapura Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Monica says she started trying her hand at paper folding during the summer break after second PU. “I had already heard about this art and was quite interested but somehow never managed to find the time for it. During those holidays, I was looking for ways to keep myself entertained when I came across an old book. It was on origami. I had had it for many years but I opened it for the first time only then. And after that, I was hooked.”

Ask her what all she has made and she rattles off a list in a delightfully childlike way. “Rose, penguin, butterfly, dog, crow, peacock, fish, turtle...” “The peacock was the very first item I made but the rose is my favourite,” she adds.

She says she didn’t think what she was doing was that amazing or creative so she never highlighted her efforts. After every model was made, she would go and quietly place it in her showcase. It was when the showcase started overflowing with paper models of animals and flowers that her parents noticed their daughter's interest. “They were quite happy about the entire thing but they didn't make a fuss about it,” she says with a shrug.

“But I was quite happy with my efforts and I had a lot of fun in the process,” she adds. “Also I was able to do something that my elder sister couldn’t. She was quite jealous and that made me more determined to continue with this hobby,” she says with a laugh.

But jokes aside, Monica confesses that she is quite close to her sister Madhuri. “She has been very supportive and encouraging of the entire process. She loves the models I made. A lot of her friends are into arts and crafts and she told me that I was as good as them,” says Monica. In fact, it was Madhuri herself who gifted that origami book to her years ago.

“She said I could even sell these or gift them to my friends,” says Monica with a smile.

So does she gift them to her friends? “Actually no. I wasn't very confident about my products. I have seen YouTube videos and the people there make great stuff, original designs. I just copy from them. So I wasn’t sure if they will like them,” she confesses, adding that she hasn’t even put up pictures on her Facebook page. “I didn’t think they deserved so much attention. I haven’t even shown my designs to anyone, except for my family and a few relatives. My relatives were quite shocked that I could make something like this,” she says.

Though Monica prefers to use proper origami paper; “it has a feel of cloth and resembles handmade paper,” she explains helpfully;  she can make-do with anything that she gets. “Since college has started, I haven’t got that much time to devote to this hobby. But when we get a free period, I tear off a page from my notebook and make something,” she says.

So what next? “I am trying my hand at kirigami now. Origami is the art of paper folding while kirigami is the art of paper cutting. It involves using scissors, something that is unthinkable in origami. I have already made a pouch for stationery under this new art,” she says, adding that she likes doing stuff with paper. “I like  doing things sitting at my table. I am the happiest during that time.”

"JAN 01 2017, 21:40 IST",Metrolife,"Anila Kurian, Jan 02, 2017, DHNS,",Off the beaten track,"Soon after Ana Carolina Tramontini came to Bengaluru in 2015, she went on a short trip to Mysuru with her friends. Upon her return, she realised that she had lost her purse containing her wallet, cellphone and passport.

She filed a complaint at the police station but the officials told her to inform the embassy about the loss. When she had lost all hope, a couple of weeks later, she received a message on Facebook from a police officer in Mysuru informing her that her valuables had been found. She went there to retrieve her things and returned feeling hopeful that this could be the country she would fall in love with.

Today, she works as a project manager at ‘Greenbooks Learning Solutions’.
The enthusiastic Brazilian didn’t know much about the country before she moved here. She says, “I was looking for a job in India and that’s when I heard about this internship with an organisation. I started researching about the work culture and how it would be to live here. Before moving, I had only heard about cities like Mumbai, New Delhi and Kolkata; the information I had about those was also quite vague.”

One of the things about Bengaluru that instantly clicked with her was the variety of food available. She says, “Apart from the great weather and abundant career opportunities, I love the array of food available here. I visit ‘Mustard Cafe’ in Koramangala at least twice a week to savour the hot chocolate. I also enjoy the food available on Mosque Road and the best part is that eateries there are open till about 1 am. For South Indian breakfast, ‘Airlines Hotel’ is the place for me.”

Before Ana moved here, she worried that she wouldn’t fit in. “But everyone was so sweet, especially my colleagues. They introduced me to the different places and have always been there for me when needed. I have had Indian food in Brazil but it can’t be compared to what is available here. It was mostly North Indian dishes like ‘chapati’, ‘naan’ and some non-vegetarian gravies that I had there. Being a vegetarian, I didn’t have much of a choice.”

Ana does miss home and the lifestyle there. She explains, “I come from a town called Balneário Camboriú which is located on the beachside. The universities are very popular there, so the population mostly comprises students and retired professionals. The city grows to almost twice its size during the summer. But since everything is closeby, you don’t need a vehicle to get to places. I miss hanging out by the beach and the park.”

That’s why she chooses to visit places in Bengaluru that are quiet. She says, “I like going to ‘The Meditating Monkeys’ to gather my thoughts. It’s also a great place to just hang out, meet new people and hear the birds!”

Sometimes, she also heads out of the city with various trekking groups. “Having grown up around the beach, I used to go on treks with my friends. However, it isn’t considered a big thing there, it’s just regular walking for us. So when I heard about trekking groups here, I thought it was a lovely idea and now I make sure to go on one at least once in couple of months,” she says. Her most exciting trekking trip was to Mount Sinai in Egypt.

Ana also likes visiting pubs that offer live music. ‘Church Street Social’, ‘Windsor Pub’ and ‘Easy Tiger’ are some of her favourite haunts. She says, “The quality of musicians in the city is phenomenal. I’m used to seeing a guy playing his guitar and singing by the beach. But here, the musicians have something different; they make a living out of music.”

Being the environment-friendly person that she is, she wishes people would stop honking on the roads. “It breaks my heart when I hear old Bengalureans talk about how wonderful this city used to be. I wish I knew what it was like then,” she expresses.

Though she doesn’t know how much longer she will be here, Ana is trying to make the most of it. “I’ve had such wonderful experiences here. I want to learn more, explore more. It’s a beautiful city and I am thrilled to be a part of it,” she says."
"JAN 01 2017, 21:42 IST",Metrolife,"Jan 02, 2017, DHNS,",Down memory lane,"While they reminisced about the golden days of the past, they also made more precious memories to savour until they meet again.

From young, innocent boys and girls in the classroom and playground to dignified gentlemen and ladies who have made their mark in various spheres, they had indeed come a long way, so much so that some even had difficulty recognising each other. With great enthusiasm, the class of 1966 of Bishop Cotton Boys’ and Girls’ School travelled from across the globe to attend the 50th year reunion that was recently organised in the city.

Brigadier Ashok Kumar from the batch organised a welcome dinner at ASC Centre on Old Airport Road, followed by a dinner hosted by Vijay R Kirloskar at ITC Gardenia on the second day.

The organising committee for the event put their best foot forward in making it a truly memorable one. ‘A walk down memory lane’ was arranged in the boys and girls school along with a visit to some of their favourite haunts like ‘Koshy’s’ and ‘Jewel Box’. The old students had a good time chit-chatting about old Bangalore, ‘boarders’ and ‘day-scholars’ and various other interesting facets of their school life.

A coffee table book, with school photographs and anecdotes, was especially brought out on the occasion and gifted as memorabilia to everyone.

 The colourful cover, designed by a caricature artist, served as the perfect backdrop against which the old Cottonians got photographs clicked. Apart from catching up with each other and cracking jokes, many also shook a leg as saxophone player Raman presented music from the 60s and 70s.

Vijay Kirloskar, chairman of the organising committee, said, “Kiran Bhat helped with locating everyone and we’re happy that most of us were  able to make it to the reunion. We also invited three of our teachers — Mr Shankar, Mr Vaz and Mr Nainan.”

S Shivaram, who had been in the school since kindergarten, expressed, “Cotton’s was like home for us. It taught us many values like honesty, being fair and helping everyone. All of us treasured each other and there was no unnecessary leg-pulling. The school instilled in us a sense of discipline and we also accepted punishments without any arguments, which is a rarity today.”

Parab, who joined the institution in class nine, said that it was totally different from his school in Kolkata. “The focus at Cotton’s was on total development, something that helped us learn to mix with different people. The reunion helped to bring back many old memories, especially ‘settling scores’ behind the chapel and gorging on the ‘chikki’, popcorn and ‘samosa’ at the tuck shop.”

For Chitra, it was a poignant occasion to meet many old batchmates from the girls school and see those from the boys school after ages.

“Our teachers actually imparted to us ‘knowledge’ rather than ‘information’. It was a holistic education. I remember Ms Holder teaching us various lovely crafts, needlework and basketwork and I was also a part of the choir. We were even taught many Western dances by experienced teachers and these skills that I learnt take many by surprise even today!”

Janaki, another old student, remarked that it was pure nostalgia as they entered the portals of the school once again. “Suddenly, we were 50 years younger and there was a gush of memories. We also saw the tree in the middle of the quadrangle where, as kids, we were made to stand for punishment. The school has changed a lot now with more buildings and less open spaces. The reunion has been like a roller coaster ride of emotions and I am glad that all of us have been able to reconnect.”"
"JAN 01 2017, 21:48 IST",Metrolife,"Tini Sara Anien, Jan 02, 2017, DHNS,",'Pop music has a certain high',"Perlita Emilya Rodrigues got inspired by music at a young age and since then, there has been no looking back. She identifies herself as a pop-music artiste and a dancer and there is no differentiation between the two for her. In a candid chat with Tini Sara Anien, this young computer-science engineering student from Vemana Institute of Technology sheds light on her passion for music and more.

How did you get interested in singing?

I started singing when I was in the second standard, after which my life has always included singing and dancing. Pop music happened to me after I became inspired by musicians like Beyonce and Rihanna. I have been doing  gigs as well as uploading live videos on Facebook.

The different languages you perform in include...

I have performed songs in Kannada, Tamil, Hindi and English. (Smiles) I love singing English tracks more as I have an accent while performing in any other language. I love singing rock or peppy numbers more than any other type of songs.

What is it about pop music that makes you continue in the genre?

I think I’m at my best when performing pop music. I’m the performer who brings her own moves into the act when she performs. I dance in a certain style, which is why I connect to artistes like Beyonce and Rihanna completely. Pop music has a certain high. The beats make one dance, which attracts and gets the attention of the audience. The crowd tends to sing along with and dance to such songs. And I feel it is a great thing to make someone break out into some impromptu steps.

Some of your favourite songs are...

I love a lot of musical numbers and I’ve played many of them, which include ‘Locked Away’, ‘Cheap Thrills’, ‘This Is What You Came For’, ‘Starving’, ‘Stitches’, ‘Say You Won’t Let Go’, ‘Into You’, ‘One Dance’ among others.

Other favourite artistes, apart from Beyonce and Rihanna?

I love V Bozeman who sang ‘What is Love’. Apart from her, I really like Sia who sang ‘Cheap Thrills’. I also love Shakira, because I’m also into singing and belly dancing.

How do you balance your passion for dance and music?

For me, they are both part of the same things. I feel dancing and singing is the best mixture possible. One listens to music and progresses according to it. I cannot differentiate between the two.

How important is an online presence for artistes nowadays?

In today’s times, one has to have a good online presence. The medium allows a better communication with people, where they are able to ‘Like’ and comment about an artiste’s work and give feedback. Also, when it comes to requests at a live gig, there are many people who will be allotted a particular slot. The personal touch feels much lesser there. This is something which is possible during online personal interactions."
"JAN 01 2017, 00:50 IST",National,"Chennai: Jan 1, 2017, DHNS,",'Will steer party in Jaya's footsteps',"In a cautious beginning to her political career, new AIADMK general secretary V K Sasikala has said no individual in the party would be projected other than founder MGR and Jayalalithaa.

Speaking to party cadres after taking charge, Sasikala also vowed to steer the party on the path shown by her predecessor.

Sasikala, who signed the register at AIADMK headquarters at Chennai’s Royapetta on Saturday to formally take over as general secretary, also urged cadres to maintain the “military discipline” instilled in them by ‘Amma’.

Stating that the Opposition parties have done everything to break the party’s unity, Sasikala, who broke down several times during the speech, said she would work for the party’s development as determined by Jayalalithaa.

Recalling her 33-year association with Jayalalithaa, Sasikala said she never expected to find herself in the position of leadership. “This has not been my ambition,” she said, adding that Jayalalithaa’s demise has been a great personal loss that cannot be described in words.  

Sasikala said the late chief minister was recovering well at Apollo Hospital during her 75-day stay and was shifted to the general ward. “She (Jayalalithaa) was treated by several medical experts, including doctors from AIIMS,” Sasikala said.

“However, when we all thought she would return home (healthy), she suffered a cardiac arrest and left us. The void (she left behind) can never be filled by anyone.”

Meanwhile, calls from within the AIADMK are getting louder for Sasikala to take over as chief minister. Several senior functionaries and Revenue Minister Udayakumar asserted that Sasikala would head the government soon.

"JAN 01 2017, 00:51 IST",National,"New Delhi: Jan 1, 2017, DHNS,",Oppn slams PM for skipping note ban,"The Opposition leaders likened Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s New Year Eve address to a budget speech and slammed him for omitting any reference to the demonetisation initiative.

“To me, this appeared like a budget speech, felt sad for the finance minister. What will he say during budget,” senior Congress leader Salman Khurshid said.

The Congress’s chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala said Modi had left several questions over demonetisation unanswered.

AICC general secretary Gurudas Kamat saw the speech as a desperate attempt by a “guilt-ridden” prime minister to appease the people with sops.

West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said Modi had not provided any concrete solutions to the problems of the people.

“Where are the figures of demonetisation? How much of black money recovered? What did the nation gain after 50 days of excruciating pain,” asked Banerjee, who has emerged as the rallying point of the anti note-ban protests.

Banerjee and Kamat also said the prime minister had left nothing for Finance Minister Arun Jaitley to announce in his Budget speech.

Swaraj Abhiyan leader Yogendra Yadav also pointed out the “repeat announcement” of the scheme for pregnant women. The scheme was part of Food Security Act, he said.

Leader of the CPM in the Lok Sabha Mohammad Salim tweeted, “People sacrificed, people waited, people disappointed. No substance in speech, no apologies for 100 deaths, no info on what all this yielded. FlopModi.”

“How much black money forfeited? When from d harassment b normal & rs15 lack b poured in individual bank a/c. No answer. Down with pmo bhasan (PMO speech),” tweeted Sujan Chakraborty on the CPM’s twitter handle.

RJD leader Lalu Prasad termed the speech “insensitive” and said it was an utter failure. “He did not speak on deaths in queues. It was a lacklustre and insensitive pre-budget speech on the eve of New Year. From Monday, people have to again stand in queue,” said the RJD leader.

AAP leader and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal accused the prime minister of cheating people.

"JAN 01 2017, 00:57 IST",National,"Dalip Singh, NEW DELHI: Jan 1, 2017, DHNS,",Modi takes forward pro-poor agenda,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi took forward his pro-poor political message by harnessing the anti-rich mood that came in the wake of demonetisation to promise a better deal and higher premium for the honest and stern punishment for the dishonest.

Modi, in a veiled attack against the Opposition, appealed to politicians to give up their “holier than thou” attitude and work towards eradicating corruption from the country, but stopped short of urging political parties to come clean on funding through transparent methods.

Throughout the early part of his 45-minute long address to the nation, which came after 50 days of announcement of demonetisation, the prime minister hailed the “patience, discipline and resolve displayed by 125 crore Indians”.

In fact, he said if socialist icons like Jayaprakash Narayan, Lal Bahadur Shastri, Ram Manohar Lohia and Kamaraj were alive today, “they would have applauded the patience, discipline and resolve of our countrymen”.

Election season
Ahead of elections to five states, including Uttar Pradesh, Modi announced a slew of schemes that were aimed at reaching out to the poor, villagers, farmers, lower middle-class, women and senior citizens.

At the same time, he whipped up sentiments to “strengthen the movement for honesty” by sharing an information to narrate shocking story of tax evaders.

He said, “can we digest” that only 24 lakh people in the country accept that their annual income is more than Rs 10 lakh.

BJP national president Amit Shah thanked the prime minister for coming up with new schemes which he said would provide “relief for all sections of society”.

Modi equated the “unparalleled” resilience shown by the people to fight black money to “collective energy and patriotism” exhibited by the nation during the fours wars – 1962, 1965, 1971 and Kargil.

"JAN 01 2017, 00:58 IST",National,"NEW DELHI, Jan 1, 2017, DHNS,",Tough road ahead for next chief justice of India J S Khehar,"Justice J S Khehar is set to assume charge as the new Chief Justice of India (CJI) on January 4, after the outgoing head of judiciary Justice T S Thakur demits office.

As the tenure of the incumbent CJI nears an end, it is time to take a look at his achievements, but more so on the challenges ahead for Justice Khehar. Justice Thakur’s stint was marked with tussle with the government on the appointment of judges.

When Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi reminded the judiciary of ‘Lakshman Rekha’ on Law Day function in the presence of Justice Thakur, it was left to Justice Khehar to counter that judiciary has always kept to it by upholding the Constitution. Justice Khehar, it is hoped, would ease the friction with the government.

Even though the government claimed that it cleared maximum appointment of judges in the recent time, the issue would require the attention of Justice Khehar.

Notably, with the retirement of Justice Thakur, the Supreme Court itself would face vacancies for eight judges out of the sanctioned strength of 31. This becomes all the more challenging with the apex court facing pendency of 61,847 cases as on December 1. Not to forget that 24 high courts, on the other hand, are still grappling with lakhs of cases with less number of judges.

In his time, Justice Thakur persisted with his demand to the government to act promptly in filling vacancies in the judiciary. He even broke down during the conference of the chief ministers and chief justices in April, apparently showing helplessness.

After invalidation of the National Judicial Appointment Commission Act, the government, on its part, took steps for the finalisation of a fresh Memorandum of Procedure (MoP) for appointment of judges, even while maintaining that its absence would not come in the way of clearing new names.

But the subject kept on rankling the judiciary, which raised objection on several issues. As the last word on the MoP is yet to come, it would remain a major task for Justice Khehar to prepare the guiding document on the selection of judges. In his short tenure of about eight months, the new CJI would also have to take along all his brother judges in the collegium."

Both of them would remain in office till 2019. While Dhanoa is slated to retire in September, Rawat would continue for another three months.

Contrary to the speculations, the senior-most army officer Lt Gen Praveen Bakshi said he would not resign from the post of the Eastern Army Commander and would extend full support to Rawat, who is one year junior to him.

The Narendra Modi government overlooked the claims of Bakshi and the Southern Army Commander Lt Gen P M Hariz to pick Rawat for the top job.

The only other time this has happened was in 1983, when the senior-most officer Lt Gen S K Sinha was not chosen by the then prime minister Indira Gandhi.

She picked Gen A S Vaidya, who was junior to Sinha by two months. A miffed Sinha later resigned. Bakshi, who met Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar a few days ago, said he would not resign.

Addressing his officers on the eve of the new year at Fort William in Kolkata, Bakshi said he would continue to lead the eastern command with “full professional sincerity as hither-to-fore”. The armoured corps officer is on leave at the moment and addressed the officer through a video link, sources said.

This is the first time in the history of the Indian Army that an officer resumes service after being ignored for the chief’s job. Hariz and Bakshi would now have to salute a junior officer. Lt Gen Bakshi made a request to stop the speculation and the trolling on social media. He telephoned Gen Rawat to congratulate him.

“With Akhilesh in command, the SP will certainly move towards a grand alliance of secular parties to win the Assembly polls,” a senior leader told DH.

JD(U) leaders revealed that the party was in touch with the Akhilesh camp during the crisis. “We offered all support to the chief minister after Mulayam Singh Yadav declared his expulsion,” a JD(U) source revealed. 

Sources said that the party had even offered Akhilesh its election symbol for the upcoming Assembly elections with all freedom to choose candidates.  However, Akhilesh is said to have expressed hope to hold on to the SP’s symbol—the bicycle.

JD(U) sources said that talks for a grand alliance will be intensified in the coming days and negotiations will be resumed. JD(U) leaders said that the party will not insist on many seats and help the SP in formalising the alliances in all possible ways.

In UP, the JD(U) is in alliance with the Rashtriya Lok Dal of Ajit Singh and has already started campaigning for elections.  Senior party leader Sharad Yadav and Ajit Singh have addressed several meetings in western Uttar Pradesh where there is a sizeable population of the Jats.

“We are trying to revive the social alliance between the Jats and the Muslims,” a senior JD(U) leader told DH."

Mujawar had claimed that three senior officials of the Maharashtra Police — two retired DGs and one high-ranking IPS official — tried to suppress information about the killings.

According to Mujawar, Dange and Kalsangra were picked up around the time when Sadhvi was arrested.

“On the night of the 26/11 attack, Anti-Terrorism Squad  (ATS) officers shot Kalsangra and Dange at Kalchowkie unit and later took their bodies to the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus. They were shown as victims of 26/11,” he had claimed, and added that he would reveal the truth before the court.

The Maharashtra government, too, has promised to  look into the matter. “We will look into the claims,” Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis said. “We will look into the entire episode. We will have to check why no inquiry was conducted if the officer in 2009 had written to the DGP,” he added.

The blast on September 29, 2008, at Bhikku Chowk in the Muslim-dominated town of Malegaon in Nashik district—on the eve of Navratri—claimed six lives and injured 101 others.
The case was transferred from the Nashik Rural Police to the ATS and subsequently the NIA took over the probe.

At 8 am on Saturday, he reportedly made a call to Mulayam arguing that the acrimonious developments which took place on Friday evening in Lucknow were neither in the interest of the Yadav family nor the Samajwadi Party. Lalu’s soft corner for Mulayam and his party is quite understandable as the RJD chief’s youngest daughter Raj Laxmi is married to Mulayam’s grand nephew Tej Pratap Singh Yadav, a Lok Sabha MP from Uttar Pradesh.

Lalu told Mulayam that such bickerings within the faction-ridden Samajwadi Party, ahead of Assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, would help the BJP sweep the polls. Mulayam reportedly told Lalu that he was helpless as his son was not prepared to listen to him and had “raised a bogey of revolt.”"

The uneasy truce in the Samajwadi Party (SP) may have allowed Akhilesh’s return to the party 24 hours after his expulsion, but he would have a difficult time getting the second term since the feud has only added to the government’s failures, the BJP said.

BJP national secretary Shrikant Sharma said people have made up their mind to bring back his party to power after 15 years to ensure all-round development.

“This is only a comeback of the chief minister to his party, but not to power as his government’s report card is full of failures,” Sharma said. “People have decided to get rid of him and the SP. His government only encouraged corruption and crime and did nothing for the common man.”

All eyes are now on the emergency national convention that SP general secretary Ram Gopal has convened on Sunday to discuss the existing situation.

Sources said SP’s Uttar Pradesh president Shivpal Yadav is unhappy over the way his elder brother reversed the expulsions. “What is left now, my reputation has taken a severe hit,” Shivpal is said to have commented when asked to attend the top-level meeting at Mulayam’s residence where Akhilesh was present.  Ironically, Shivpal was sent to the media to break the news on Akhilesh’s and Ram Gopal’s reinstatement. The national convention called by Ram Gopal, one of  the reasons for the
expulsions, will be held as scheduled.

On Friday, Mulayam had questioned Ram Gopal’s authority to convene the meeting and made it clear that it did not have his approval. He said the convention was not recognised and warned that he would take disciplinary action against those attending the meeting.

“The convention will be held as per schedule...the decision to hold the convention was taken before the expulsion....the delegates will discuss the state of affairs of the party and take appropriate decisions,” Ram Gopal said on Saturday.

“We have been saying we are ready to contest all seats in the Uttar Pradesh elections. The Congress is capable of contesting all seats on its own,” Randeep Singh Surjewala, in-charge of the AICC Communications Department, said here.

Surjewala underlined that the Congress had crafted its campaign in Uttar Pradesh on the theme ‘27 Saal, UP Behaal’ indicating that it included the “misrule” of the Samajwadi Party government .

The Congress made it clear that it was not ready to uproot the green shoots of development that were a result of Rahul Gandhi’s meticulous efforts through Kisan Yatra to reach out to the common man in the state.

“Congress leaders are in the field and we are hopeful of setting aside the politics of caste and religion, espouse the path of politics of development and make a new beginning,” Surjewala said.

A section in the Congress strongly favours an alliance with the Akhilesh Yadav-led faction of the SP, hoping to cash in on the clean image of the young chief minister and his good equation with Rahul Gandhi.

In his New Year’s Eve address, the prime minister also handed out tax concessions to small traders who have suffered more due to cash crunch induced by the scrapping of 86% of India’s total currency on November 8 last year.

Modi also sent a terse warning to those who had tried to hide their incomes despite the government giving them ample opportunity to declare their assets.“The law will take its own course, with its full force,” Modi said adding that only 24 lakh people have admitted that they earn more than Rs10 lakh a year.

In announcements that almost sounded like a mini-Budget, he offered interest subsidy on home loans for rural and urban poor. Now, home loans for poor and middle class up to Rs 9 lakh will get a 4% exemption on interest and up to Rs 12 lakh will get 3% exemption in urban areas. Another 3% interest waiver will be offered on loans up to Rs 2 lakh for construction of houses in rural India under Prime Minister Awas Yojana.

For senior citizens, he handed out an assured return on their fixed deposits, irrespective of the banks cutting the deposit rates. “We have decided that up to Rs 7.5 lakh in fixed deposits for 10 years will get them an interest of 8%,” Modi said in his televised address to the nation, the second in a space of two months.

With an eye on elections in Uttar Pradesh and four other states, he said the government will bear the interest for 60 days on crop loans taken by farmers from district cooperative banks and primary societies for sowing operations this rabi season.

In the same vein, he also announced that three crore Kisan Credit Cards will be converted into RuPay Card within three months to help farmers purchase various inputs anywhere. Nabard will be given an additional Rs 20,000 crore to finance district cooperative banks and societies. This will be over and above Rs 21,000 crore announced earlier.

Women who undergo institutional delivery will get an assistance of Rs 6,000, he said adding that the move will check maternal mortality rate.

Announcing doubling of credit guarantee to Rs two crore to small-scale and medium enterprises, which play a significant role in increasing job opportunities, he asked the banks to be sensitive towards the needs of the poor and the middle class and restore normalcy as soon as possible.

Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said the prime minister’s announcements will enhance economic activity.

Mulayam also reinstated his brother and party general secretary Ram Gopal Yadav.

“On the direction of Netaji (Mulayam), the expulsion of Akhilesh Yadav and Ram Gopal Yadav is revoked with immediate effect...we will all collectively fight the communal forces and form a majority government in the state again,” SP’s state unit president Shivpal Singh Yadav tweeted.

The patch-up was announced following a meeting Mulayam had with Shivpal and Akhilesh at noon on Saturday. Sources said Akhilesh had sought the expulsion of SP Rajya Sabha MP Amar Singh from the party; removal of Shivpal as the state unit president and nomination of his supporters as candidates for the Assembly elections.

Sources said Mulayam had agreed to consider the list of probables sent to him by Akhilesh. “A new list of candidates will be released after consultations...we are all united...there is no misunderstanding now,” said Shivpal.

While the SP legislators and ministers made a beeline before the official residence of the chief minister on a foggy Saturday morning to attend the meeting convened by him and pledged their support, barely a handful of loyalists turned up at the meeting called by Mulayam at the party office.

According to sources, 212 MLAs and MLCs, including 195 of the SP, attended Akhilesh’s meeting. In contrast, only 20 legislators were present at Mulayam’s meeting.

As Mulayam and Shivpal found themselves outnumbered, senior party leader Azam Khan, an Akhilesh supporter, intervened and brokered a truce among the warring members of the Mulayam family.

Sources said Mulayam did not want a showdown, especially when it was clear that Akhilesh enjoyed the support of the majority of the party legislators.

"JAN 01 2017, 11:02 IST",National,"New Delhi, Jan 1, 2017, PTI,","2016: 122 journalists killed globally, 5 in India","As many as 122 journalists and media professionals were killed in 2016 globally, 93 of them in targeted killings and others in natural disasters and accidents, while India witnessed death of five scribes and was eighth on a list topped by Iraq, according to a new report.

The targeted killings, including murders, bomb attacks and crossfire incidents, span 23 countries in Africa, Asia Pacific, the Americas, Europe and the Middle East and Arab World regions, said International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) in its annual report released Friday.

The IFJ said the number (93 targeted killings) was down from 112 targeted killings in 2015 while Iraq still had the largest number of media killings with 15, ahead of Afghanistan (13) and Mexico (11).

These were followed by Yemen (8), Guatemala (6), Syria (6), India and Pakistan (5 in both), according to the  statistics published by the largest global federation of journalists' trade unions.

In addition to the 93 targeted killings, 20 Brazilian sports journalists perished in a plane crash over the city of Medellin in Colombia, a country where for the first time in many years no killing was recorded this year, against three in 2015. Nine Russian journalists were killed in a military plane crash.

Although the 2016 figures for targeted killings of media professionals are down from the previous year's, the IFJ has cautioned against complacency citing reports of rising threats, intimidation and self-censorship as evidence that attacks on freedom of expression remain at critical levels.

In India, Tarun Mishra, Bureau Chief of Jan Sandesh Times, died on 14 February; Indradev Yadav, Journalist with Taaza TV, on 16 May; Rajdeo Ranjan, Bureau Chief of Dainik Hindustan on 13 May; Kishore Dave, Bureau Chief of Jai Hind on 22 August and Dharmendra Singh, Correspondent of Dainik Bhaskar on 12 November, the report noted.

In 2015, India had reported targeted killings of six media professionals, including those from news channel Aaj Tak and Hindi daily Dainik Jagaran, the report states.

Noting that India along with Yemen, Pakistan and Syria form a group which saw little or no change in the numbers of killings from 2015, IFJ President Philippe Leruth said, ""Any decrease in violence against journalists and media staff is always welcome but these statistics and the continued deliberate targeting of media workers in many incidents causing loss of life give little room for comfort nor ground for hope to see the end of the current media safety crisis.""

The IFJ, which claims to represent more than 6,00,000 journalists in 140 countries, has recorded at least 2,297 killings of media professionals in targeted assassinations, cross-fire incidents and bomb attacks till 2015."
"JAN 01 2017, 11:53 IST",National,"Bundi (Rajasthan), Jan 1, 2017, PTI,",Villagers barter wheat with groceries to beat currency blues,"Cash-starved farmers in Bundi villages - where ATM and bank branches are hard to find - have resorted to the ancient barter system, exchanging wheat and pulses with other commodities.

For farmers in the villages it is literally a return to the old days.

Wheat is currently being sold for Rs. 21 to 24 per kg but the locals in villages are forced to purchase commodities weighing equal to wheat thus running into losses.

Even as the Prime minister has been stressing on digital and cashless transactions, the villagers, most of whom don't know the meaning of these words feel 'Acche Din to nahi lakin purane din lot aaye hai' (Not the good days but the old days have returned).

""For the last couple of weeks I have been exchanging wheat for vegetables and other items of day-to-day needs from the grocery shop,"" said Sheogiram Meena, a farmer in Ganeshpura village near Bundi.

Mulibai of the same village said she purchased vegetables and grocery items from the village shop in exchange of wheat weighing about two kilogrammes.

During the drought some years ago, the locals in the village had adopted the same practice, she recalls.

Bharulal Gujjar and Mewalal of Sakatpura village of Kaithuda panchyat of the district, which has a population of around 1400, say as soon as the villagers get news about availability of cash in the ATM at Jarkhoda village, which is 12 kms away, people rush to get cash and sometimes return disappointed as the cash runs out.

Chatarganj village of Hindoli gram panchyat, with a population of about 3600, has no bank branch, ATM, online payment or swipe machine facility and the local villagers have to travel a long distance to get cash.

Kaithuda, Maani and Balkasa villages of the district are also among other places where no bank branch or ATM exists."
"JAN 01 2017, 12:23 IST",National,"Lucknow, Jan 1, 2017, PTI,",SP splits as convention declares Akhilesh party chief,"Ruling Samajwadi Party today finally split with Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav being anointed the SP president upstaging his father Mulayam Singh Yadav, who yet again expelled Ram Gopal Yadav from the party for six years and termed as illegal all decisions taken at a national convention convened by him.

The national convention, earlier in the day, also proposed the expulsion of ""outsider"" Amar Singh and removal of Shivpal Singh Yadav from the post of SP's UP chief. Stung by these ""decisions"", Mulayam struck back, issuing a hard-hitting letter that said the national convention had not been convened with permission of the national president and so all decision taken there are illegal.

""The parliamentary board of the party declares all the proposals, decisions and the convention itself illegal and expels Ram Gopal, who convened the convention, for six years,"" the letter stated. The bitter power struggle hit a new low with Mulayam also convening a national convention of the party on January 5 at the same venue here to show people as to who had more clout in the party.

Crisis refused to die down in the party as Akhilesh was ""unanimously"" crowned the SP national president at the conention a day after over 200 of the 229  party MLAs met him at his residence here at a show of strength which left his father's camp with barely 20 MLAs. The proposal to make Akhilesh SP chief was welcomed by a huge applause by party cadres gathered at the sprawling Janeshwar Misra Park raising their hands.

Ram Gopal also moved a proposal to make Mulayam Singh, the founder president of the party, as party patron and removing Shivpal Yadav from the state unit post. Earlier this morning as soon as the national convention got underway at the park, Mulayam issued a letter declaring the convention as ""unconstitutional"". ""Today a so-called convention has been convened by Ram Gopal. This is against party constitution and discipline. This has been convened to damage the party,"" Yadav said in the letter.

Although Mulayam warned that participation in the convention will be taken as indiscipline and action will be initiated against those attending it, almost all the senior leaders who had been longtime associates of Mulayam shared the dais with Ram Gopal and Akhilesh. Soon after being proposed as the national president of the party, Akhilesh said his respect for his father was more than ever and that he would stand against those conspiring against the party.

""Those who conspired against the party, damaged it and also posed problems before the national president...should know that my respect for the national president (Mulayam Singh) will be more than before,"" the chief minister said. ""...People might raise questions and level allegations but I said this before and say it again that as his son if there is any conspiracy against the party and him it is my duty to stand against them,"" he said. ""I had said that I was ready to step down as state unit president earlier too... He had made me the CM and gave me a chance to work...,"" he said.

The convention also authorised Akhilesh to constitute a national executive, parliamentary board and various state units, as required, and inform the Election Commission of the developments at the earliest. The fresh developments have almost left both Mulayam and younger brother Shivpal isolated in the party. Soon after he was made the national president, Akhilesh said, ""I had stated that I was ready to step down as the state unit president earlier too, but one person brought the typewriter at Netaji's home and got the letter of my removal from the post typed.""

The chief minister said, ""All want that SP comes back to power but there are some who do not want this...Netaji would be most elated if the party forms the next government...I have been given the responsibility to make the next government on one more time. ""Netaji's respect and position is supreme for us...These three-four months are very important....Don't know who all can come together and force certain decisions,"" Akhilesh said.

In his address at the convention, Ram Gopal said that all are aware that the government was working well but two persons conspired and got Akhilesh removed from the state president's post and posed a big problem in the party. Blaming Shivpal Yadav for working in an arbitrary manner, he said that tickets were being given to those who are not even members of the party.

""The state unit president gave tickets to those who were not even member of the party...Despite directives from the national president, the state unit president revoked the suspension of those shown the door...It is clear that some people do no want SP to return to power and Akhilesh to become the chief minister again,"" he said. When the problems became insurmountable the party workers gave him a request in writing to convene an emergency convention and he waited for two months before convening today's meeting, Akhilesh said.

Making a dramatic U-turn yesterday, SP revoked the expulsion of Akhilesh and Ramgopal Yadav after a massive show of strength by the chief minister who convened a meeting of SP legislators where over 200 of the 229 party MLAs turned up expressing their loyalty. Reacting to the developments, senior SP leader and MP, Naresh Agrawal said, ""When lakhs of people have chosen Akhilesh as the party president, then who has the right to remove anyone.

""Netaji is our leader, we all respect him. I would like to tell Netaji that if your son is moving forward and is making you proud, then you should shun your relations with the people who are trying to break your family and because of whom there is a feud within the party. If Netaji still doesn't pay heed to the public opinion, then it is unfortunate,"" he said.

In more signs of defiance, Akhilesh went ahead appointing MLC Naresh Uttam as the new state president, replacing his warring uncle Shivpal. The appointment made by Akhilesh was informed by senior SP leader Rajendra Chaudhary.

Soon after the appointment of the new state unit president, supporters of Akhilesh laid siege to the state SP headquarters here in the high security VIP zone and forcibly wrenched out the nameplate of Shivpal to ventilate their ire.

Despite a heavy deployment of police force outside the party office since the morning, Akhilesh loyalists barged into the premises, prompting Shivpal to allege that the chief minister was ""misusing"" the police machinery by allowing such hooliganism.

Heavy deployment of UP police and contingents of PAC was seen outside the party office on Vikramadiyta Marg where supporters of Shivpal too protested his removal from the post of state SP chief, often coming to blows and giving the police a trying time in controlling the crowd.

Soon after arriving at the party office to take charge, Naresh Uttam said that his aim would be to ensure the victory of SP in the coming Assembly polls and make Akhilesh the chief minister again. To a question, he said Akhilesh will decide the tickets on the remaining seats.

Uttam also addressed party workers in the office, asking them to gird up their loins and work for the party's thumping victory in the upcoming battle of ballots. In a related development, Mulayam expelled national vice president Kiranmoy Nanda and general secretary Naresh Agarwal from the party. In a letter addressed to Nanda, Mulayam noted that he had taken part in 'emergency national representatives convention' which is not only ""unconstitutional but also amounts to anti- party activity"".

Citing relevant sections of the party constitution, the letter stated that the said convention was not convened by the national president and despite being a senior member Nanda took part in it. The letter stated ""for taking part in the unconstitutional national representatives convention and continuous involvement in anti-party activities, he is being removed from the post of national vice president and he also ceases to be the primary member of the party"".

Nanda had chaired this morning's convention convened by Ram Gopal Yadav which appointed Akhilesh as national president, removed Shivpal as state unit chief and expelled Amar Singh from the party formalising a vertical split in SP. Naresh Agarwal has also been expelled from the party for taking part in the convention, a senior party leader said."

Sujit (19), a first year student, died on the spot and his 16-year-old friend was injured when members of a rival group attacked them at 3 AM during new year celebrations at Kottayamkkad in Elavancherry Panchayat in Palakkad.

The youth had been hospitalised with serious injuries, police said.

There was previous enmity between two groups of people which led to the stabbing, they said, adding, further investigation was underway.

The CPI(M) activists were attacked at Panur in Kannur following a dispute with the RSS workers over who should write 'Happy New Year' graffiti on the road, they said.

The injured persons had been rushed to the Kozhikode Medical College Hospital and the condition of one of them is stated to be serious, police said.

Elsewhere, Keralites ushered in the New Year by thronging temples and churches across the state and offering prayers.

"JAN 01 2017, 14:27 IST",National,"New Delhi, Jan 1, 2016, PTI,",Extra second added to Indian time,"A 'leap second' was added to the Indian clock at 5:29.59 hours today to synchronise with the Earth's rotational clock.

As the atomic clock at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) here struck 23:59:59 last night, it was programmed to add an extra second to 2017 to compensate for a slowdown in the Earth's rotation.

Adding a second barely has an impact on the daily life, but it does matter in the fields of satellite navigation, astronomy and communication.

""The Earth and rotation around its own axis is not regular, as sometimes it speeds up and sometimes it slows down, due to various factors including earthquakes and moon's gravitational forces that often results in ocean tides.

""As a result, astronomical time (UT1) gradually falls out of sync with atomic time (UTC), and as and when the difference between UTC and UT1 approaches 0.9 seconds, a leap second is added to UTC through atomic clocks worldwide,"" D K Aswal, Director NPL said.

Adding the leap second to the Indian clock is done by the NPL under the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (SCIR). The NPL, one of the oldest laboratories in the country, has five atomic clocks and nearly 300 such pieces exist across the globe.

Atomic clocks are so precise that the margin of error in its functioning is just of a second in 100 million years.

To be in sync with the Indian Standard Time (IST) and the Earth'ss rotational clock, the Indian clock need to be adjusted after the insertion of a leap second.

Aswal said the Indian atomic clock was also synchronised with the atomic clock of International Bureau of Weight and Measure (BIPM), France.

""The leap second adjustment is not so relevant for normal everyday life. However, this shift is critical for applications requiring of time accuracies in the nanosecond, which are critical in the fields of astronomy, satellite navigation, communication networks,"" Aswal added.

Those utilising CSIR-NPL time dissemination services need not worry as they will receive the corrected time post the insertion of the leap second, Aswal said.

Since 1972, 36 leap seconds have been added at intervals varying from six months to seven years and this will be 37th year."

""India and Pakistan today exchanged, through diplomatic channels simultaneously at New Delhi and Islamabad, the list of nuclear installations and facilities covered under the Agreement on the Prohibition of Attack against Nuclear Installations between India and Pakistan,"" the Ministry of External Affairs said.

The agreement, which was signed on December 31, 1988 and entered into force on  January 27, 1991, says that the two countries will inform each other of nuclear installations and facilities to be covered under the agreement on January 1 of every calendar year.

This is the 26th consecutive exchange of such list between the two countries, the first one having taken place on January 1, 1992.

The two countries also exchanged, through diplomatic channels simultaneously at New Delhi and Islamabad, the lists of nationals (including civil prisoners and fishermen) of each country lodged in their respective jails as per provisions of the Agreement on Consular Access, the MEA said.

The agreement on consular access, signed between the two countries on May 21, 2008, provides for exchanging a comprehensive list of nationals of each country lodged in their jails twice each year -- on January 1 and July 1.

""India remains committed to addressing with Pakistan on priority the humanitarian matters, including those pertaining to prisoners and fishermen in each other's country.

""In this context, we await from Pakistan confirmation of nationality of those in India's custody who are otherwise eligible for release and repatriation.

""We also await consular access to those Indian nationals in Pakistan's custody for whom it has so far not been provided including Hamid Nehal Ansari and Kulbhushan Jadhav,"" said an MEA statement.

The Pakistani security forces had arrested Jadhav from Balochistan in March and alleged that he was ""a serving officer in the Indian Navy and deputed to the Indian intelligence agency Research and Analysis Wing (RAW)"".

Jadhav has been accused by Pakistan of planning ""subversive activities"" in the country.

India has acknowledged that Jadhav had served with the navy but denied that he has any connection with the government.

Pakistan has so far turned down India's request for consular access to Jadhav, whom Pakistan claimed to be a RAW spy.

Ansari had crossed over illegally to Pakistan from Afghanistan in 2012 reportedly to meet a girl he had befriended online and then went missing.

He was later arrested and tried by a Pakistani military court, which pronounced him guilty of espionage."

Addressing the 19th Foundation Day programme of TMC here, its vice president Mukul Roy said the party will work to unite the opposition forces for the next general election. ""As our party and our supremo Mamata Banerjee had opposed the anti-people decision of demonetisation, vendetta politics will intensify in days to come. But that can't stop TMC from opposing anti-people decision,"" Roy said.

""We will not stop until and unless we play a decisive role in national politics in days to come. In 2019, TMC will play a major role in government formation by uniting opposition forces,"" the senior TMC leader said. His statement came just days after Trinamool Congress MP Tapas Pal was arrested by CBI for his alleged involvement in Rose Valley Chit Fund scam.

CBI has accused the ponzi firm of duping investors of Rs 17,000 crore, of which Rs 450 crore is from Odisha alone. The company was active in Odisha and had 28 branches in the state.

Suspended Trinamool Congress MP Kunal Ghosh is also out on bail in cases related to the multi-crore Saradha chit fund scam. Ghosh was suspended by the Trinamool Congress in September, 2013 for anti-party activities after he had started making allegations of involvement of some party leaders in the scam. Investigation into the ponzi scam, which came to light in 2013, revealed that the Saradha Group had allegedly cheated investors of Rs 1,200 crore in mainly rural areas, as per an official estimate. The CBI had taken over the investigation in June, 2014 following an order of the Supreme Court.

Attacking the Prime Minister on demonetisation, he said the move had ""made poor farmers stand in long queues for their own money.""

Kejriwal alleged that the BJP leadership had sounded their near and dear ones before announcing demonetisation. He termed demonetisation as the ""biggest scam"" in the country post Independence. Delhi Deputy CM Manish Sisodia also targeted Modi and criticised demonetisation, claiming it had failed to achieve the desired objectives of ending corruption, black money, fake currency and funding of terror networks.

""On the contrary, it has hit all sections of the society, especially the common people,"" he said. Speaking on the occasion, Jaihind claimed that AAP will win 100 of the 117 seats of the poll-bound Punjab state."
"JAN 01 2017, 21:17 IST",National,"Lucknow, Jan 1, 2017 (PTI),","SP splits, Akhilesh faction upstages Mulayam as party chief","The ruling Samajwadi Party in Uttar Pradesh today split down the middle with the faction headed by Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav removing Mulayam Singh Yadav as party chief and appointing him in his place at a convention in which the group claimed support of the majority of legislators and district units.

On a day of face paced developments, the two sides engaged in mutual recriminatory expulsions with the convention called by Ram Gopal Yadav removing Akhilesh's warring uncle Shivpal Yadav as state party chief, and showing the door to ""outsider"" Amar Singh, who has been blamed for the feud in the Yadav clan.

Mualyam retorted by again expelling his cousin Ram Gopal for six years along with national vice president Kiranmoy Nanda, who chaired the convention, and general secretary Naresh Agarwal for taking part in it.

43-year-old Akhilesh was ""unanimously"" crowned the SP president as Ram Gopal moved a proposal to make Mulayam, the founder president of SP, the party patron at the convention, where the CM's faction claimed that over 200 of the party's 229 MLAs, around 30 MLCs, besides majority of office bearers of district units were present.

The convention also authorised Akhilesh to constitute a national executive, parliamentary board and various state units, as required, and inform the Election Commission of the developments at the earliest.

The proposal to make Akhilesh SP chief was welcomed by a huge applause by nearly 5,000 partymen who had gathered at the sprawling Janeshwar Misra Park here.

Mulayam termed as illegal all decisions taken at the convention. In a hard-hitting letter, he said the convention had not been called with permission of the national president and so all decision taken there were invalid.

In a counter move, he also convened a national convention of the party on January 5 at the same venue here.

Although Mulayam warned that participation in the convention will be taken as indiscipline and action will be initiated against those attending it, almost all senior leaders who had been longtime associates of Mulayam shared the dais with Ram Gopal and Akhilesh.

Addressing the convention, Akhilesh said he respected his father more than ever and that he would stand against those conspiring against the party while Ram Gopal attacked Shivpal for working in an ""arbitrary"" manner, alleging tickets were being given to those who are not even members of the party.

The fresh developments which almost left both Mulayam and younger brother Shivpal isolated in the party came a day after SP revoked the expulsion of Akhilesh and Ram Gopal amid the running bitter turf battle in the Yadav clan which threatens to affect its prospects in the upcoming Assembly election.

In more signs of defiance, Akhilesh appointed MLC Naresh Uttam as the new state president, replacing Shivpal.

Soon after the appointment of the new state unit president, supporters of Akhilesh laid siege to the state SP headquarters here in the high security VIP zone and forcibly wrenched out the nameplate of Shivpal to vent their ire. 


Earlier this morning as soon as the national convention got underway, Mulayam issued a letter declaring it ""unconstitutional"".

""Today a so-called convention has been convened by Ram Gopal. This is against party constitution and discipline. This has been convened to damage the party,"" he said.

""The parliamentary board of the party declares all the proposals, decisions and the convention itself illegal and expels Ram Gopal, who convened the convention, for six years,"" the letter said.

Soon after his name was proposed as the national president of the party, Akhilesh said, ""Those who conspired against the party, damaged it and also posed problems before the national president...should know that my respect for the national president (Mulayam Singh) will be more than before.""

""...People might raise questions and level allegations but I said this before and I say it again that as his son if there is any conspiracy against the party and him it is my duty to stand against them,"" he said.

The chief minister said, ""All want that SP comes back to power but there are some who do not want this...Netaji would be most elated if the party forms the next government...I have been given the responsibility to make the next government one more time.

""Netaji's respect and position is supreme for us...These three-four months are very important....Don't know who all can come together and force certain decisions.""
In his address at the convention, Ram Gopal said that all are aware that the government was working well but two persons conspired and got Akhilesh removed from the state president's post and posed a big problem in the party.

""The state unit president gave tickets to those who were not even member of the party...Despite directives from the national president, the state unit president revoked the suspension of those shown the door...It is clear that some people do no want SP to return to power and Akhilesh to become the chief minister again,"" he said, attacking Shivpal.

When the problems became insurmountable the party workers gave him a request in writing to convene an emergency convention and he waited for two months before convening today's meeting, Akhilesh said.

Reacting to the developments, senior SP leader and MP, Naresh Agrawal said, ""When lakhs of people have chosen Akhilesh as the party president, then who has the right to remove anyone.

""Netaji is our leader, we all respect him. I would like to tell Netaji that if your son is moving forward and is making you proud, then you should shun your relations with the people who are trying to break your family and because of whom there is a feud within the party.

""If Netaji still doesn't pay heed to the public opinion, then it is unfortunate,"" he said.
Heavy deployment of UP police and contingents of PAC was seen outside the party office on Vikramadiyta Marg where supporters of Shivpal too protested his removal from the post of state SP chief, often coming to blows and giving the police a trying time in controlling the crowd.

Akhilesh loyalists barged into the premises, prompting Shivpal to allege that the chief minister was ""misusing"" the police machinery by allowing such hooliganism.

Soon after arriving at the party office to take charge, Naresh Uttam said that his aim would be to ensure the victory of SP in the coming Assembly polls and make Akhilesh the chief minister again.

To a question, he said Akhilesh will decide the tickets on the remaining seats.
Uttam also addressed party workers in the office, asking them to work for the party's thumping victory in the upcoming battle of ballots."
"JAN 01 2017, 23:17 IST",Opinion,"Vindu Goel and Mark Scott, Jan 02, 2017, International New York Times,","Apple, Nokia spat over patents gets uglier","Apple’s iPhone is a technological marvel. You can watch streaming video on it, download apps, take photos with its camera and give voice commands to Siri, its digital assistant. You can even make old-fashioned voice calls on it.

Nokia, the Finnish company that was the world’s largest cellphone maker until its business was decimated by Apple and makers of Android-based phones, claims none of those features would exist without its inventions, which were made over many years and after billions of dollars were invested in research.

For the past five years, Apple has paid Nokia a modest royalty for the use of its patents. But with that pact expiring on December 31, Nokia wants Apple to keep paying for that portfolio, and is demanding that Apple licence additional patents. Apple is refusing to pay Nokia’s price and has accused it of extortion.

The impasse, after two years of tense negotiations, broke into open warfare last month in a volley of lawsuits in 11 countries, including the United States and Germany.

“Apple is saying, ‘we want to pay one low price and not have to deal with any of your patents again’,” Clem Roberts, an intellectual property lawyer at Durie Tangri in San Francisco, said. “Nokia is saying, ‘I don’t want that low price because my patents are worth more than that.’”

The fight underscores just how much today’s smartphones rely on an earlier generation of technology. It also shows how cellphone pioneers like Nokia, Ericsson of Sweden and Motorola, whose patents are now owned by Google, are still trying to profit from the industry in which they are now bit players, at best.

“Obviously, the iPhone was not created on a green field but was built on what others created before Apple,” said Florian Mueller, a German iPhone app developer and former consultant to technology companies who has followed the cellphone patent wars. “On the other hand, the iPhone was a paradigm shift. It was more of a mobile computer than a mobile phone.”

Patent disputes are common in the technology industry. This month, for instance, Samsung won a partial victory over Apple when the US Supreme Court ruled that it should not have to give up all of its phone profits for copying the look of Apple’s iPhone. Google, part of Alphabet, won a similar case against Oracle in May after it was accused of copying software code used for Android, the search giant’s smartphone operating system.

But the tactics are evolving as the law and technology change.
When the Supreme Court a decade ago limited the leverage that patent owners had to stop sales of a product that violated their patents, it empowered patent users to play hardball in negotiations, Roberts, the intellectual property lawyer, said.

Companies like Nokia and Ericsson, which once had an interest in exchanging mutual licences with other companies for their own cellphone businesses, left the handset market and concentrated on other tech gear and licensing their old patents. Nokia and Ericsson each make more than $1 billion a year from licensing their patents and brands globally, their annual reports say.

Nokia has split its patent portfolio and transferred slices to patent trolls — a derisive term for companies that buy others’ intellectual property and often file lawsuits to extract royalties from patent users — with Nokia sharing in any profits.

In its legal filing on Tuesday, Apple claimed that this strategy was a conspiracy between Nokia and its patent partners, which include Acacia Research and Conversant Intellectual Property Management, to raise patent prices in violation of federal antitrust law.

Apple said Acacia and Conversant had filed 52 cases against the company around the world, many asserting violations of Nokia patents. In September, Acacia won a $22.1 million jury verdict against Apple, and last week, Conversant won $7.3 million.
“Unfortunately, Nokia has refused to licence their patents on a fair basis and is now using the tactics of a patent troll to attempt to extort money from Apple by applying a royalty rate to Apple’s own inventions they had nothing to do with,” Apple said in a statement about the case.

In response, Nokia filed legal cases against Apple in 14 venues, from Texas to Japan accusing it of violating 40 patents. Nokia said it had reached patent deals with more than 100 other companies, including many smartphone makers, which demonstrated that it had offered its intellectual property at a fair price.

“After several years of negotiations trying to reach agreement to cover Apple’s use of these patents, we are now taking action to defend our rights,” Ilkka Rahnasto, the head of Nokia’s patent business, said in a statement.

Important patents

Analysts say there is no doubt that Nokia owns important patents, which include those related to how phones transmit data and how their batteries consume energy.
Ericsson, which also had a long-standing legal dispute with Apple before they agreed to a new licensing deal last year, similarly has a large portfolio of patents — including technology for how smartphones make calls and how video is beamed onto a handset.

“Unless there’s a fair return on this technology, the whole model for the telecom world is at risk,” Gustav Brismark, Ericsson’s chief intellectual property officer, said. He added that the company had invested billions of dollars over decades in its patents.

In the past, Brismark said, companies quickly reached agreements over how to use Ericsson’s patents. But in the past five years, companies like Apple have more often turned to courts to reach settlements.

Central to the latest dispute between Apple and Nokia is what is a fair and reasonable fee to use Nokia technology that is now part of every smartphone.

Patent lawyers say there has been a tradition of charging a modest royalty for patents on standard technologies. Previously, Nokia fought bitter legal battles with other smartphone makers, including Samsung and LG, over how they used its patents.

As Nokia seeks to require Apple to pay to licence more of its patents, some of its recent claims may be hard to justify. In one of its lawsuits filed last month, it says Apple is violating a patent Nokia received two months ago for an electronic device case that includes a hole for a camera lens in the back and room for a battery beneath the display, features that have been common to smartphones for many years.

Still, Roberts said US courts have been sceptical of patent-related antitrust claims like those by Apple. “The whole point of the government granting these patents is that it was giving the inventor a monopoly over that invention,” he said.

But Apple and Nokia are fighters, and too much is at stake for either to give up easily. “What is a fair return on technology that has been shared with everyone?” Brismark of Ericsson said. “You have to create the right incentives for tech pioneers.”"
"JAN 01 2017, 23:20 IST",Opinion,"B K Singh, Jan 02, 2017,","Proposed 'Canara trail' illegal, threat to biodiversity; scrap it","The proposal of the Forest Department to open 270 km-long trekking trail through one of the most pristine forests of Uttara Kannada is a threat to biodiversity conservation. The proposal is to open India’s longest forest trekking and canopy walk from Jog Falls in Shivamogga district to Castle Rock in Uttara Kannada  district.

The places covered on route are Jog Falls, Kattekan, Garuda Jog, Unchalli, Devimane Ghat, Shivaganga Falls, Ganesh Falls, Bedti river valley, Lalguli, Kali River, Shivapura in Anshi, Ulavi, Kumarwada, Kuveshi, Diggi and Castle Rock. The 108 km of this trek between Ulavi and Castle Rock is planned to be opened in the first phase, of which 97 km falls in Kali Tiger Reserve.

A total of 27 places for halt along the route have been proposed to be developed with camping facilities like temporary structures and tents for accommodation etc. This itself would to an ecological disaster. Already there is uncontrolled/unregulated flow of tourist in these areas and nothing is done to reverse the trend. The trail route passes through Katlekan and Malemane forest areas, rich in rare Myristica Swamps, Kumbara frogs and lion-tailed macaques. Katlekan is a highly fragile area and the roots of the swamps can get damaged with increased human activities.

Why 97-km trek route between Ulavi and Castle Rock, passing through Kali tiger reserve is illegal? With regard to Section 38V of Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, the core areas of the tiger reserves are inviolate forests. With this, attempts are being made to relocate villages from the core areas of all tiger reserves. Tigers being at the apex, all other species of fauna would also receive better protection if the area is freed from human and cattle population.

Whenever human activities increase in the forests, there will be degradation and fragmentation leading to loss of biodiversity including disappearance of wild animals. Experiments regarding tenure social dynamics of tigers show that it is necessary to have 800 to 1,200 sq km of inviolate forests with adequate prey population and proper connectivity for long-term conservation of tigers. Even if there are 25 breeding tigresses in such forests, the area will have a tiger population of 70 to 75 including cubs. In such a scenario, one or two poaching per year will also not threaten the extinction of the species.

The Kali Tiger Reserve, which was earlier called Anshi- Dandeli Tiger Reserve, is having a large number of human habitation in its core area. Unless these villages are relocated and the tiger reserve is freed from human and cattle pressure, there is no question of building healthy prey density and consequently a better tiger density. The management has a huge task ahead to make this tiger reserve inviolate.

The tiger density here is less that two tigers per 100 sq km and the management will have to toil a lot to bring it to the level of Bandipur and Nagarhole. While that being the case, opening a trekking trail for canopy walk for 97 km is adding further disturbance in the reserve and revival of prey and predator will be a distant reality.

Allowing tourism in core area of the tiger reserve is a matter which has been settled in the Supreme Court. After a prolonged public debate, the National Tiger Conservation Authority has formulated a guideline on the subject, which has been endorsed by the court. According to this guideline, not more than 20% of the core area in any tiger reserve or the existing area already under use for tourism, whichever is less, will only be opened for tourists’ visits.

SC guidelines

The guidelines further add that the number of visits on any day should not exceed the carrying capacity. The Kali tiger reserve has already opened some area for tourists’ visit. It will be in contravention of the Supreme Court approved guidelines, if more areas are added for the visit of the tourists.

Some Tiger reserves in Madhya Pradesh and Uttarakhand had opened more than 60% core area for tourism in the past. In compliance with the guidelines, when it was incumbent on the respective management to restrict tourism area, they started computing only the area occupied by roads and view lines, which is highly misleading.

The entire core area including the habitat between any two roads will have to be included in it. When tourists’ vehicles move on the road, the habitat between the two roads is seldom used by wide ranging animals.

In the circumstances, as narrated above the proposed Canara trail has to be restricted to 173 km between Jog Falls and Shivapura in Anshi. I support education and awareness programme for the citizens, which ultimately helps the conservation. However, I am not in favour of opening long trail for canopy walk in pristine areas. Though these areas are still not included in the `protected area’ network, many of these patches are of very high biodiversity value and require as good a protection as tiger reserves.

The Forest Department must think of shorter trails without going through pristine areas and sensitive patches of myristica swamps etc. The proposal for creating temporary infrastructure for stay of tourists etc will never find a favour from conservationists.

We know that a large number of illegal trekking is already happening in Karnataka. We also hear the tourists losing way in the forests and sometimes even resulting in their death.

Private tour operators exploit them by charging a hefty sum for sending a guide and organising their stay. The trekkers are generally innocent young persons from the urban areas who go for wilderness experience and adventure.

The proposal of the department to regulate trekking in the forests should be welcomed. The proposed Canara trail requires a relook and Forest Department must discharge their main duty of conservation and development of forests and wildlife.

"JAN 01 2017, 23:23 IST",Opinion,"Jan 02, 2017,",Off the record,"Aid or raid?

Even as his troubles with Sasikala acquire new dimensions following her taking charge as the AIADMK general secretary, Tamil Nadu Chief Minister O Paneerselvam has advised the TN Bhavan officials in Delhi not to remove the portraits of Jayalalithaa or replace them with his picture. During his visit a few days ago to the capital, Paneerselvam also refused to stay in the CM’s suite in the Bhavan, preferring to stay in one of the rooms kept for ministers. He also did not use the elevator that was specially erected for Jayalalithaa’s use.

Incidentally, the income tax raid on chief secretary Ram Mohana Rao took place a day after Paneersevlam called on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, seeking Central aid for the cyclone-hit state. With many AIADMK tongues wagging about the timing of the raid, a political aide could not help wonder whether the CM asked for “aid” or “raid.” The action on Rao led to speculations about the I-T raid being targeted at those who are seen as very close to Sasikala, like mining baron Sekhar Reddy.

Stoic silence

Leaders across party lines are puzzled over the stoic silence maintained by Janata Dal (United) national president and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on the issue of demonetisation. In the initial days of the note ban, Nitish had praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi and asserted that the move would help strengthen economy. But when it started affecting the common man adversely, Nitish said he would review his stand after December 30, when the PM’s deadline ends.

Two days after the deadline, the ‘review’ is yet to come. Neither his alliance partners – the RJD and the Congress – nor the Opposition BJP can hazard a guess on which side of the fence Nitish is. Some believe that Nitish would avoid saying anything against Modi till January 5, the day when the PM will share dais with the Bihar CM on the occasion of Prakash Parv in Patna. Modi will address the gathering here on the occasion of the 350th birth anniversary of Tenth Sikh Guru Guru Gobind Singh. Till the Sikh fest is over, Nitish is unlikely to create any bad blood.

The big miss

In what was a first, the Press Information Bureau (PIB) decided to compile Cabinet decisions of a year but what made it notable was the omission of a big announcement that rocked the country. The PIB went on a drive on New Year’s eve to publicise the decisions taken by the Modi government. It came up with two press releases — one on decisions taken since May 2014 when the NDA government took charge and another on decisions taken in 2016.

While the first one had over 33,900 words, the second release had around 11,000 words. However, those who compiled the list forgot to add a couple of decisions. Among them was the Cabinet move on demonetisation taken on Nov 8 and an ordinance to give legal backing to it. How it was omitted is now a million dollar question.

Foiled plans

Many big hotels in Chennai had organised New Year’s eve bash by offering attractive discounts to their customers. However, the effect of demonetisation persisted as many of the organisers could not sell the tickets. Some even had to cancel their programmes due to poor response. However, a leading resort hotel near the outskirts of the city issued many leftover tickets as complimentary to its staff to draw the crowd.

An auto driver who procured a couple of tickets for the New Year’s bash from his neighbour – who is a staff of that hotel – drove to the event with a friend in his own auto. When the hotel authorities refused to allow the auto inside the parking area, the angry driver tore the tickets and came back with his friend to the city to watch a movie on the New Year’s night.

PM eligible

Infamous for courting controversies with his remarks, Uttar Pradesh minister and senior Samajwadi Party (SP) leader Azam Khan, a well-known critic of PM Narendra Modi, thinks that he is the right person for the country’s top job as he possesses all the qualities required for a person at that position. These qualities, among others, included ”making tea.”

“I can not only make tea but also play drum,” he recently said at a function in his Assembly constituency of Rampur. “'I have more qualities that are required to be possessed by a prime minister,” he added. The sarcasm was clearly evident as he went on to declare that he would have Rs 25 lakh deposited into the bank accounts of every citizen of the country if he became the prime minister, which was again a barb aimed at PM Modi’s promise about bringing back black money stashed in Swiss banks.

"JAN 01 2017, 23:32 IST",Opinion,"Kalpana M Naghnoor, Jan 02, 2017,",Towards a 'cleaner' India,"A year has passed so fast, yet again. This New Year arrives quietly with the effects of demonetisation affecting us from last year. The entire nation has stood resolute with the Prime Minister to wipe out black money, deep cleansing and detoxing our nation! There is no need for any more resolutions this year.

Our nation has proved its mettle. We have possibly stunned the world in the way we embraced demonetisation. The world has understood that if need be, India will work together as a nation to pull through a situation. It is not without glitches that we strive, but the fact that we strive is what’s important.

Fortunately for us, this year began on a Sunday. So there was enough time to slug off the eve’s overload, keep the day joyous for the year we’ve had and for the year we look forward to. Life is never without ups and downs, yet we need to commit ourselves to “Swacch” Bharat.

I wish I could have begun the year on a sentimental note, but I am afraid that I may have to be more pragmatic. I must look around me and understand the quandary that belies the many faces I meet. Cashless? Their eyes seem to enquire, uncomprehending the plausibility of the word and the enormity of its ramifications, as they are not geared for it.

We need to be ready to spread awareness to those around us, help them learn the new ways of transacting and the new norms of economic living. I took my 87-year-old mother to the bank to teach her how to use her debit card. While she thoroughly enjoyed the process, she also enjoyed the laconic humour of a bystander who remarked, “I never handle cash; my wife has all of mine!” 

Not funny? Well, for those who are caught in disputes and other ordeals, the trouble doubles, and for those who are too rich to notice, good luck to you. It seems like you always knew! To many of us who have penned our theories on demonetisation and a cashless economy, it is the year we wait in anticipation of our predictions — and for those of us who have been skeptics, let us hope we aren’t proved wrong. No sentiment this year, I say again, let’s get practical, and help those who need our help towards a cashless society.

For those who have furrowed brows of worry, here is a word of solace. Demonetisation is like a detox programme, to remove the toxin of corruption, and going cashless is like a ‘plastic’ surgical strike. Dietitians will tell you how good a detox is for your system, especially for the ones who worry about ageing and the wrinkles. If this made you smile, keep the cheer and if not Happy New Year!"
"JAN 01 2017, 23:26 IST",Opinion,"Jan 02, 2017, DHNS,",Govt using CBSE to control education,"The CBSE’s move to exercise absolute control over the appointment of principals in schools affiliated to it is wrong and ill-conceived. The CBSE has been working on it for some time. It had first decided on a plan with two elements in it. One was that all candidates who wanted to be appointed principals had to pass an eligibility test. Apart from teachers, even those who were already principals had to clear the test, called the Principal Eligibility Test (PET). But principals of government schools were exempted. The idea of a PET is reported to have been dropped now. But the second part of the proposal remains, and that is enough for the board to gain full say in the appointment of principals.

An amendment to the CBSE’s affiliation bye-laws proposes the inclusion of representatives of the board and the state government in the committee for selection of the principal of a school. Earlier, this committee consisted of the president of the society, the chairperson of the managing committee and a person nominated by the committee. According to the new rule, the selection committee’s recommendations “shall invariably have concurrence” of the two new members. This means the CBSE’s and the government’s representatives will have veto power over the appointment of any person as the principal. This is unfair, and amounts to gross interference in the affairs of the school by the CBSE and the government. In effect, the government will decide who is to become the principal of a private school, as the CBSE, being controlled by the government, will have no independent view. Control of education is high on the agenda of this government, and appointment of principals offers a good platform for that. This seems to be the motive behind the move.

There are about 10,000 private schools affiliated to the CBSE. Affiliation is an academic process and does not give the CBSE any administrative and management control over the school. The managements of schools which have invested in them have the right to appoint the teachers and the principals. The government, through the CBSE, is trying to rob the management of their rights and their responsibility to the students and their parents. The schools will also be deprived of their autonomy. It is for the managements to run and administer the schools efficiently. They should have the freedom to choose principals who can best do this. The CBSE’s move does not make sense administratively and academically. It will also be found lacking in legal merit. The board should drop the move altogether. "
"JAN 01 2017, 00:47 IST",Sports,"Jan 01, 2017, Rajkot, PTI,",Steely TN eye Mumbai scalp," A humdinger is in the offing when 41-time champions Mumbai meet a high-on-confidence Tamil Nadu in the Ranji Trophy semifinal here on Sunday.

Both teams go into the key clash following exciting victories in the quarterfinals.
Tamil Nadu thrashed Karnataka at Visakhapatnam with the game wrapped up in two days, while Mumbai dug deep to eke out a 30-run win against Hyderabad on the fifth and final day at Raipur.

Tamil Nadu’s performance under new head coach Hrishikesh Kanitkar has been nothing short of commendable. The way they played against a star-studded Karnataka last week have taken their morale to the next level.

The two-time champions, who last got their hands on the Ranji Trophy 28 years ago, have reached this far without the services of star players Ravichandran Ashwin and Murali Vijay. They outplayed Karnataka, a side that was boosted by the return of Lokesh Rahul and Karun Nair, who had earlier been on national duty.

Mumbai start favourites, simply because of their unmatched record in the competition, but they would have to pull out all stops against their South Indian opponents.

The two sides had also met in the group stage in October when Mumbai pulled off a two-wicket win with the match at Lahli ending within three days.

However, a lot has changed for Mumbai since that game in October. The Lahli game saw their premier pacer Dhawal Kulkarni take 10 wickets but he is now injured alongside regular opener Akhil Herwadkar and Shubham Ranjane.

However, the fitness issues have given a chance to youngsters and a name that attracts instant attention is that of 17-year-old Prtihvi Shaw.

Shaw is best known for his 546 off 330 in a Harris Shield match in November 2013.
Mumbai’s leading run scorer this season has been Shreyas Iyer with 553 runs at an average of 42.53. It has been a mixed run for the top-order batsman and he would be itching to make it count in the all-important semifinal.

The leading wicket-taker has been left-arm spinner Vijay Gohil with 24 wickets at 22.04. He, alongside Abhishek Nayar, secured a tight win against Hyderabad by picking up five-wicket hauls. The defending champions would surely have to up their against Tamil Nadu.

Tamil Nadu’s star performers with the bat have been Kaushik Gandhi and Mukund, with 726 and 689 runs respectively in nine matches.

The revelation has been their three-pronged pace attack comprising Aswin Crist, K Vignesh and T Natarajan, who have a cumulative experience of 38 First-Class games.

Keen contest in the offing
In what promises to be an enticing contest full of interesting sub-plots, Gujarat boasting of Ranji Trophy’s highest run-getter Priyank Panchal will be pitted against Jharkhand that has top wicket-taker Shahbaz Nadeem in their ranks in the semifinal in Nagpur.

While both teams are not exactly traditional heavyweights but they have performed consistently on neutral venues riding on some talented but unheralded name in domestic cricket.

Gujarat has had some powerhouse batting performers like Panchal who has scored more than 1100 runs this season. Not to forget opener Samit Gohil, whose 359 not out was a world record in first class cricket for an opener who carried his bat through.

And above all the ‘towering presence’ of pocket sized dynamo in their skipper Parthiv Patel, who needs less than 400 runs to complete 10,000 runs in first class cricket.
For Jharkhand, a lot will depend on how well left arm spinner Nadeem, who has 50 wickets already this season, bowls on Jamtha track.

Nadeem’ s discipline needs to be complemented by likes of Rahul Shukla.
Jharkhand’s batting depends a lot on young left-hander Ishan Kishan, leading the chart with 719 runs including a 273 against Delhi. His lusty hitting during the fourth innings chase in their quarterfinal tie against Haryana has certainly caught the attention of many."

Asked if the IOC plans to take action against IOA for its decision to elevate Kalmadi and Chautala as life presidents, IOC Media Relations Manager Michael Noyelle told PTI in a written reply that it will first get in touch with the NOC of India.

“The IOC will be in touch with the NOC of India in due course to assess the situation,” the IOC official said.

The IOC headquarters are currently closed for their annual break. Meanwhile, IOA President N Ramachandran said that he will take up the issue of IOA’s suspension with the government after consulting the IOC and Olympic Council of Asia.

Cracking the whip on IOA, the Sports Ministry on Friday suspended the national Olympic body till the time it reverses the decision to make Kalmadi and Chautala its life presidents.

“I am away in New Zealand, on a personal issue relating to my family. I understand that the government has suspended the Indian Olympic Association due to the conferment of life-time presidency to Mr. Suresh Kalmadi and to Mr. Abhay Singh Chautala,” Ramachandran said in a statement.

The veteran administrator, who was heading World Squash Federation before taking over as IOA chief in 2014, added, “The IOA is a body that has to function under the guidance and supervision of OCA and IOC. On my return in the New Year I shall discuss this issue with the OCA/IOC after their offices open in the New Year for their guidance and advice, and thereafter take this up with the government to see how this issue can be resolved.”

The government took the firm decision to suspend IOA after it failed to reply to its showcause notice within the stipulated December 30 deadline.

Kalmadi spent nine months in jail after allegations, stemming from the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi. He was released on bail pending an appeal to Delhi High Court and has denied any wrongdoing.

Chautala is also facing unrelated corruption charges in an ongoing court case. He has also denied the allegations.

Following the suspension, the IOA will cease to enjoy the privileges and prerogatives bestowed on it by the government as the National Olympic Committee (NOC).

Bindra lauds Ministry’s ‘bold move’

Olympic champion Abhinav Bindra (in pic) backed the Sports Ministry’s decision to suspend the Indian Olympic Association and called it a “good step” following the sports body’s move to honour two scam-tainted administrators.

As a result, the Vijay Goel-led ministry on Friday suspended the IOA.
“The @Olympics movement and specially the movement in India can no longer hide behind autonomy. It’s the age of good governance and ethics,” Bindra wrote on his twitter handle.

The 2008 Beijing Olympics gold medallist added, “Change in Indian sport will only happen if mandated. A law is necessary in India. A good step by @IndiaSports & @vijaygoelbjp to suspend IOA.”"

India’s number one player Myneni, ranked 192 in the world, had a good 2016 year as he qualified for the US Open and it would need a herculean effort from him to make a winning start to the new season after being drawn against the world number 57 from Russia.

It will not be a smooth road for Ramanathan since he is set to play two seeded players - Benoit Paire (ranked 47) and Aljaz Bedene (101) — if he gets past the qualifier.

“I had a good off season for 10 days before coming here. Each match at this level would be tough but I will put in my best efforts before my local fans who would be rooting for me like last year,” Ramanathan said.

Myneni looked unfazed when drawn to play Youzhny but conceded he has to be on top of his game to drive past the highly consistent Russian player.

“Yes, it is going to be a big challenge for me. He has been a top player for so many years. I have to bring out my best if I want to make a good start to 2017. I am looking forward to it,” he said.

The defending Asian Games mixed doubles gold medallist and men’s doubles silver medallist is brimming with confidence after a highly successful year. “I was out for two months following a surgery. I had a good off-season and I am ready for 2017.”
In the doubles, India’s top pair of Rohan Bopanna and Jeevan Nedunchezhiyan will take on Marcelo Demoliner of Brazil and Croatia’s Nikola Mektic.

The other pair of Purav Raja and Divij Sharan, however, will run into countryman Leander Paes and his Brazilian partner Andre Sa.

Meanwhile, the top four seeds in the tournament, top seed and world number six Marin Cilic, twice winner of the title here, Spaniards Roberto Bautista Agut (ranked 14), Albert Vinolas Roma’s, Martin Klizan (Slovakia) have been granted byes.

Agut said it would be tough to get into the groove in first tournament after the off-season.

“It’s always tough, after not having practised for one or two months. But I’ve been to this tournament on number of times in the past and played my best tennis here,” he said.  "

Stoke twice hit back to level after falling behind at Stamford Bridge, but Willian's second goal and a late Diego Costa strike saw Chelsea match Arsenal's run of 13 wins within the same season from 2001-02.

Antonio Conte's side pulled nine points clear of second-place Liverpool, who host third-place Manchester City later in the day in an explosive climax to the calendar year.

Manchester United came perilously close to seeing their own winning streak end, only for late goals by star signings Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Paul Pogba to secure a 2-1 home win over Middlesbrough.

It was sixth-place United's fifth straight league win and took them to within a point of fourth-place Arsenal, who host Sam Allardyce's Crystal Palace on New Year's Day.
Chelsea welcomed back N'Golo Kante and Costa from suspension for the visit of Stoke and took a 33rd-minute lead when Gary Cahill headed in a corner from Cesc Fabregas.

Bruno Martins Indi equalised within seconds of kick-off in the second half, slotting in after Peter Crouch nodded down Charlie Adam's free-kick.

After Willian had restored the hosts' lead, lashing in from Eden Hazard's lay-off, Crouch drew Stoke level again in the 64th minute when he tapped in Mame Biram Diouf's cross.

But Willian put Chelsea back in front a minute later and Costa's late strike sealed victory.

United rally

At Old Trafford, United produced a comeback reminiscent of the glory years of the watching Alex Ferguson to continue their recent upturn. But they had to do it the hard way, with Ibrahimovic initially denied an 18th goal of the season in a contentious incident late in the first half.

Leaping to meet Anthony Martial's left-wing cross, the Swede jabbed the ball past goalkeeper Victor Valdes at the near post, only for referee Lee Mason to rule it out.
United's players, and Jose Mourinho, contested the decision, and there was worse to come when Grant Leadbitter drilled Boro in front from Alvaro Negredo's knock-down in the 67th minute.

But Ibrahimovic did get his goal in the 85th minute, tucking in Martial's cross, and barely a minute later Pogba headed in the winner from Juan Mata's cross. Champions Leicester City claimed a much-needed win, beating West Ham United 1-0 courtesy of Islam Slimani's 20th-minute header to climb six points clear of the relegation zone.
Swansea City made a demoralising start to life without sacked manager Bob Bradley, slumping to a 3-0 home defeat against Bournemouth that kept them at the foot of the table.

Goals from Benik Afobe, Ryan Fraser and Josh King gave Bournemouth victory, with first-team coach Alan Curtis taking temporary charge of Swansea.

Andre Gray became the first Burnley player to score a Premier League hat-trick as Sean Dyche's men beat third-bottom Sunderland 4-1.

Gray scored three times in the first 53 minutes at Turf Moor, with Ashley Barnes netting a penalty before Jermain Defoe replied for the visitors.

Matt Phillips and Wales's Euro 2016 star Hal-Robson Kanu scored as West Bromwich Albion came from behind to win 2-1 at Southampton, who had centre-back Virgil van Dijk sent off late on for two bookable offences."

The opening contest will see two of the best players of the current generation Carolina Marin of the hosts and PV Sindhu of Smashers in action. The match will be one of the highlights of the fortnight-long league.

Hunters, who finished fifth in last year’s edition, have lined-up Olympic champion Marin and a lot will be expected of her after a great year on the international calendar. While her presence will be a huge boost, a lot will also depend on how the trio of Rajiv Ouseph of England and Indian pair of Sameer Verma and B Sai Praneeth perform in the tournament.

Smashers, the semifinalists of the last edition, will be all eager to go the distance this year. The team has instilled their faith on Sindhu and bought her back to lead the team, and going through a purple patch she will be expected to play a huge role in the team’s progress.

Bengaluru Blasters were the bottom-placed team last season and that is one of the main reasons they have a new look squad going into this year’s tournament. With an eye on the trophy, the Blasters have drafted in the Rio Olympics bronze medalist Viktor Axelsen of Denmark to deliver the goods for them in the tournament. Apart from the Dane, their men’s singles department boasts of Thailand’s Boonsak Ponsana and India’s Saurabh Verma.

Defending champions Delhi Acers in a bid to win the title for the second time will step on the court with a fairly new-look squad. With the presence of Danish heavyweight Jan O Jorgensen and South Korea’s Son Wan Ho, they will be one of the most dreaded in the tournament as far as the men’s singles matches will be concerned. A lot will depend on how these two perform during the course of the tournament. Jwala Gutta, the ace doubles specialist, will be the key player in the mixed doubles. If she performs to the best of her abilities, it will give Acers a fine chance of retaining the championship.

The runners-up from last edition, Mumbai Rockets’ title hunt will be led by Indian duo of Ajay Jayaram and HS Prannoy and the Korean superstar Sung Ji Hyun.

The semifinalists of last season Awadhe Warriors will be looking to rejuvenate their last year’s form and go a step further in this year’s tournament.  "

""Starting 2017 on a new note, retiring from pro tennis. Thanks to everyone for the love and support over the years. #newyearnewbeginnings,"" Somdev said on his Twitter page.

The 31-year-old's career was hampered by a recurring shoulder injury in 2012. He recovered to stage a comeback but he had been missing from action without any specified reason for some time now.
There is speculation that he might take to coaching from here on.

Somdev was India's star singles player since he first broke into the scene in 2008.

A regular in India's Davis Cup squad, Somdev appeared in 14 rubbers and played a crucial role in India reaching the World Group back in 2010.

Somdev had also made the finals of two ATP Tour events -- the 2009 Chennai Open as a wildcard and the 2011 South Africa Open. He also the singles and doubles gold medals at the 2010 Asian Games in Guangzhou, China.

His 44–1 win-loss record in 2008 at the NCAA Men's Tennis Championship remains unmatched so far.
He was conferred the Arjuna award -- the country's second highest sporting honour -- in 2011."
"JAN 01 2017, 19:08 IST",Sports,"New Delhi, Jan 1, 2017 (PTI),","Sakshi, Geeta to spearhead Indian challenge at PWL 2","With the likes of Sushil Kumar and Yogeshwar Dutt opting out, all eyes will be on Rio Olympics bronze-medallist Sakshi Malik and the Phogat sisters, who are making headlines owing to a blockbuster biopic on them, when the second edition of Pro Wrestling League (PWL) starts here tomorrow.

Although much of the sheen is lost due to the absence of star male Indian wrestlers, including the suspended Narsingh Yadav, the women are expected to shine during the 18-day long event to be held at the KD Jadhav Wrestling Stadium. Six franchises -- Delhi Sultans, UP Dangal, Haryana Hammers, NCR Punjab Royals, Mumbai Maharathi and Jaipur Ninjas -- will be vying for the top honours with the final being slated on January 19.

The spotlight will be on Sakshi, representing Delhi Sultans, and her bout against Geeta Phogat of UP Dangal team in women's 58kg is expected to grab the maximum eyeballs. In the most anticipated bout of the tournament, Sakshi, who is finally out of the shadow of Geeta with an Olympic medal, would be carrying an immense burden of expectations on her shoulders while the eldest Phogat sister would also be under pressure.

She has been in the limelight after the Aamir Khan-starrer biopic on her struggles -- 'Dangal' -- proved to be a mammoth box office success. Besides Sakshi, the Delhi team boosts of Ukrainian Mariya Stadnik (women's 48kg), who won a bronze at the 2008 Olympics before bagging silver at the 2012 and 2016 Olympics, and Uzbekistan's Bekzod Abdurakhmonov (men's 70kg), who finished fifth at the Rio Games.

Geeta and Babita Phogat will be at the forefront for the UP Dangal team. Belarus' Maria Mamashuk, who clinched the silver at the Rio Olympics, will be the foreign import to look out for. However, Cuba's Livan Lopez Azcuy has opted out of the tournament and is being replaced by Tariel Gaprindashvili. Meanwhile, it is going to be an interesting inaugural match between Mumbai and Haryana tomorrow and the latter would be desperate to avenge the last season's defeats.

Mumbai had beaten Haryana twice last season. Once during the league stage, the defending champs got the better of Haryana 4-3 and then bagged the trophy with a comprehensive 7-2 win in the final. Mumbai have roped in quite a few strong wrestlers this time around as well with three Olympic and World Champion medallists in their line up.

Rio Olympics champion Erica Wiebe of Canada will be the biggest strength for Mumbai, while Jabrayil Hasanov of Azerbaijan is World Championship silver-medallist along with bronze winner Pablo Olenik, who has replaced another Cuban wrestler Reineris Salas. They also have in their ranks, Carolina Castillo Hidalgo, who missed Rio Olympics bronze medal by a narrow margin.

On the other hand, Haryana Hammers will be relying on world champion Magomed Kurbanaliev of Russia, Rio bronze medallists Sweden's Sofia Mattsson and Marwa Amri of Tunisia. Among Indians, they have high hopes from Asian champion and Rio Olympian Sandeep Tomar. In the men's 97kg, a high-profile bout is on the cards between World championship silver medallists Abdusalom Gadisov and Pablo Olenik.

Punjab Royals will be heavily banking on their foreign buys such as Vladimir Khinchegashvili (gold in Rio Games), Togrul Asgarov and Vasilisa Marzaliuk (fifth at Rio Games). The newest addition to PWL 2, Jaipur franchise would be hoping to make a mark with Rio Games bronze-medallist Jenny Franson of Sweden and Venezuela's Betzabeth Arguello, besides the heavyweight Georgian duo of Elizbar Odikadze and Yakob Makarashvili.

They would also rely on their highest buy Ritu -- the youngest of the Phogat sisters. Incidentally Ritu became the costliest Indian female wrestler during the PWL auctions last month."

Once the day's play was over, Dhoni was seen chatting with the boys as they were going through their cooldown routines.

Dhoni has been actively involved with Jharkhand's campaign this season as a mentor and has been present during a number of Jharkhand's Ranji Trophy matches including their fixture against Maharashtra at the Karnail Singh Stadium.

Having retired from Test matches, Dhoni has had more time now at his disposal. He has had a lot of influence on players like Ishan Kishan, Kaushal Singh, Shahbaz Nadeem to name a few.

With Dhoni around, one can also expect that Gujarat's Priyank Panchal who has been the top-scorer in this edition with 1164 runs so far will get to chat with the Indian captain. "

Asked if he will think of retiring if he gets to record 43rd Davis Cup win, Paes replied:""You will see.""

""I play for fun now. I play because I love the game, because I am passionate about the game. There will come a point when the curtain comes down. Before the curtain comes down, a big thank you to you all. It's been a fun run, you guys have been awesome with me for 20 years, so thanks,"" Leeander said on the sidelines of Chennai Open.

With Mahesh Bhupathi taking over as the non-playing captain of the Indian Davis Cup team, Paes was asked the obvious question knowing his 'blow-hot-blow cold' relationship with his former doubles partner.

""People out there need to have credentials to be the captain and he (Bhupathi) has got credentials to be captain. In the next 18 months, we will see how it goes,"" Paes told PTI during an exclusive chat.

Asked if he will be comfortable having Bhupathi in the Captain's chair, Paes retorted,""Why not?""

""Country comes first. No egos. As far as I am concerned, there has never been ego. If you have to achieve excellence, you have to be student of life. Captain sits on the bench, helps you out with a few things but at the end of the day, I am out there representing the country.

""So for me, whether it was Ramesh Krishnan, SP Misra, Naresh Kumar, my first captain, Anand Amritraj or Jaideep Mukherjee or Mahesh, I have one job to do and that is to represent country,"" Paes emphasised.

Paes and Bhupathi had emerged as a force in late 90s in international tennis, winning three Grand Slams together before parting ways.

Their stormy relation apart from their exploits together as a team has always been a topic of discussion in Indian tennis.

Bhupathi, who replaced Anand Amritraj, will take over from April. It fuelled speculation on how the two legends will go keeping in mind the history they share.
Paes, a veteran of 54 Davis Cup ties, said he had some good memories with Anand as captain.

""Congratulations to Anand for years, we have played together. We had some memorable matches, when we beat Korea in Chandigarh also when I beat my former partner Nenad Zimonjic in the doubles in Bangalore against Serbia. That was one of my best Davis Cup comebacks. So thanks to Anand and congratulations to Mahesh.""
However, Paes chose not speak on issues that resulted in change in captaincy.

Asked if he thinks, there was indiscipline in the team under Amritraj’s reign, Paes said, “That you have to ask AITA. I am a player under the captain and it’s not right for a player to speak about captain.”

Paes is close to a historic achievement as a win in the doubles against New Zealand in the upcoming tie, will make him the most successful doubles player in Davis Cup with 43 wins.

""To continue at 43, I am blessed to be playing at this level. I have to thank my whole team: my father, Sanjay Singh, Dave Herman, Rick Leach...the list just keeps going on, we have got few people new on my team now, who are going to help me in the last few months of my playing career and my post-tennis career.""

Paes also spoke about mentoring the younger lot.

""I would love to create someone who is winning for the first time and make him realise what it takes to win that first one. And when they do show that little girl what it is to win 5-6 times. That's the dream I have now, more than playing the 8th Olympics or winning the 20th Grand Slam.""

The marquee match saw the Spanish girl enjoying the last laugh winning 11-8 12-14 11-2.

Chennai came back into the contest with Tomy Sugiarto winning the first men's singles beating B Sai Praneeth to make it 1-1.

The top British husband-wife pair of Chris and Gabby Adcock won the mixed doubles rubber which Chennai had marked as their 'Trump match'. The win gave them two points and made it 3-1.

In a must-win second men's singles match of the day, Rajiv Ouseph of Hyderabad scored a thrilling 11-6 11-8 11-6 win against Tanongsak Saensomboonsuk to make it 2-3.

Hyderabad had no option but to choose the final men's doubles rubber as their 'Trump match' where Boon Heong Tan-Wee Kiong Tan beat Mads Pieter Kolding-B Sumeeth Reddy 11-7 and 11-8 to make it 4-3.

Earlier in the Marin versus Sindhu encounter, the first game saw the Spaniard opening the scoring, only for Sindhu to equalise soon after. It was a to and fro action with both the players scoring on regulation. With scores tied 4-4, it was the Spaniard who opened up a three points gap to go up 9-6. Sindhu pulled one back, but Marin quickly stole one more point to go up 10-8.

With game point in her favour, Marin did not try to do anything enterprising and was eventually rewarded for her patience as the Chennai player hit the nets to let her rival walk away with the opening game.

In the second game, it was Marin who started from where she left and took the attack straight to her opponent. She notched up points at will to go 5-2 up and it looked like she will not have to lose much sweat in the second game.

However, Sindhu had other plans and she fought her way back to take five consecutive points to lead the game 7-5. The Spaniard however was in no mood to let go her opponent so easily and she took four points on the trot to go up 9-7.

Sindhu stole one and so did Marin and with the score reading 10-8 in Marin’s favour, it looked like match was all but over. However, Sindhu fought back brilliantly to not only save three match points but to win 14-12 and level the match.

With the high intensity action in the second game, it looked like the deciding game would be even more action packed. But Marin did not even let Sindhu settle and stormed her way to take the 11-2 and win the match and also break Sindhu's unbeatable run in the league.

Delighted with her win, Marin said,""It was a wonderful match and the way the crowd was behind, it was wonderful. Their support meant and lot and helped me to perform a lot better."""

Srinath, who had unearthed the BEML Employees Housing Society scam, had been reported missing since Thursday.

Police took four office-bearers of the society, an official of the Mysuru Urban Development Authority (MUDA) and his car driver for investigation on Saturday. Srinath had unearthed various scams of the society in connection with the development of Rajarajeshwari Layout in the city.

Srinath and his family had been residing at Rajarajeshwari Layout developed by the society since 2008. The society had allotted the sites without providing basic amenities such as drinking water, streetlights and roads. Even after repeated petitions to the society, the authorities failed to provide facilities and Srinath had obtained related documents about the layout from MUDA under RTI Act, said his brother Srinivas.

Srinath brought to light anomalies like illegal allotment of sites, land encroachment and others through the documents he had procured. The society had obtained 105 acres of land from MUDA by providing fake documents and had encroached agriculture lands which were not acquired by the government. Srinath launched a legal fight against the society, said Srinivas.

Srinath’s friend Lokesh said site registration and transfer of site documents had stopped after Srinath launched the legal fight. Srinath provided documents to farmers who approached the court, questioning the encroachment of their land by the society.

Passengers complained that the airline kept delaying the flight’s departure till afternoon when it eventually cancelled it. The airline announced at 8.30 am that the 9 am flight would be delayed and would instead take off at 9.30 am. A further delay until 10.30 am was announced, while take-off was once again put off till 11.30 am.

“They finally announced the cancellation at 2.30 pm,” Steve, one of the passengers, told DH, adding that the airline did not serve breakfast until 11.15 am, despite of the fact that there were many children and women who had arrived at 6 am to board the flight.

“We left Bhatkal at 3 am,” said another passenger.
Sources said a few passengers confronted the airline staff demanding the reason for cancellation, which it did not provide. No alternative arrangements were made. “Some passengers have booked tickets via Mumbai or Bengaluru,” Steve said.

“Some of us have to join work on January 1 and have other commitments,” said a passenger, pointing out that the airline could have helped by announcing the cancellation earlier to allow them time to make alternative arrangements.

Jet Airways officials promised a press release on the delay, but the airline had gone silent since.

“The central bank has started functioning like a local cooperative society. On Friday, it instructed all banks to remit all specified bank notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 denominations with it or the attached currency chests,” a top bank official of a public sector lender told DH.

“Bank branches are keeping huge cash in crores and it is impossible to remit entire cash at one go,” the official said.

Purushotham A P, manager of the Chitradurga branch of IDBI bank, was more vocal.
“Currency chests have no space to keep cash. They are refusing to accept old notes due to shortage of space. Rural branches will face transportation issues. In semi-urban locations, just one or two chests are functioning and they can’t accept cash from all branches. Such branches are instructed to remit money at distant places where more chests are available.”

“Some banks had instructed their officers to remit cash late on Friday at 10 pm. Bank officials were still in the banks and getting ready for cash remittance. Some managers are taking huge cash in their own vehicles. Who will take care of our security?” Purushotham said.

Another bank manager said, “The RBI should think of practical difficulties before issuing any circular. At least, senior bank officials should convey problems faced by the bankers while shifting huge money at short notice. Who cares for bankers’ safety?”

Banks have been transferring money to currency chests on a day-to-day basis.
“For the past one week, chests are flooded. We have to transfer currency from chests to the RBI. For that we have to get permission from the RBI. We have been regularly moving cash from our branches to the chests. But the currency chests are flooded and the RBI has not given the lifting order,” another official said.

“The RBI should have given orders in advance to shift currency to the chests. On Friday evening, the RBI instructed to deposit the cash. In a normal course, if it is within city limits, the chests are accessible. In rural and semi-urban areas spread far and wide, for them to come and deposit the money will take time. However, all people are on the job to comply with the guidelines. It is impossible to clear currency in a single day,” the official said."

He, however, dared the Centre to stop the project if the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) hadn’t okayed it.

When journalists asked him whether the Union minister had lied about the MoEF permission, Rai evaded a direct answer and merely said, “It’s common sense that no project can be implemented without approval from the Centre.”

Accusing the BJP of “misleading” the people on the project, he said, “It was on July 13, 2012, when the BJP was in power, that administrative approval was given to the project following submission of revised estimates.”"

The campaign ‘Year of the Wild’ was launched by Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and Minister of State for Tourism Priyank Kharge on Saturday.

Speaking on the occasion, Kharge said the Tourism department, in association with the Forest department, had identified nine eco-trekking routes in the Western Ghats which will be opened to tourists and trekkers soon.

Trained nature guides will accompany and educate tourists about nature conservation on these trekking routes, he said.

Kharge said Karnataka had the largest number of eco-lodges with 17 jungle resorts and five jungle camps.

Surfing festival

He said an international-level surfing festival will be held in Mangaluru in mid-2017 to promote Karnataka’s beaches as a water sports destination.

Siddaramaiah also launched a mobile app that provides app-based reservation system for Karnataka State Tourism Development Corporation hotels. The app provides access to a database of all trained and certified tourist guides in the state and tourists can directly call these guides and fix appointments with them.

A department official said KSTDC will provide 5% discount on tariffs for its hotels and tours, if booked through the app."

The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) and other urban bodies will issue notifications on Monday asking violators to regularise buildings built before October 19, 2013, by paying a penalty. They will get four months’ time to submit applications after which no exemption will be given.

The decision to issue the notification was taken at a meeting chaired by Chief Minister Siddaramaiah. This was the first meeting chaired by the chief minister after the high court scrapped a batch of petitions questioning the Akrama-Sakrama scheme. According to the BBMP, there are at least 1.54 lakh properties in Bengaluru, which await the Akrama-Sakrama scheme.

Eshwar B Khandre, Minister of State for Municipalities and Local Bodies, told reporters that regularisation of buildings will be done according to norms laid down in the Karnataka Town and Country Planning Rules.

“Emphasis was laid on making the process transparent. The applications will be received manually as well as online. This scheme will be applicable to the BBMP, 10 municipal corporations and 60 urban bodies,” said Khandre.

Bengaluru Development Minister K J George said residential buildings and commercial buildings with less than 50% and 25% deviation respectively will be regularised.

“If the deviation is more than the prescribed limit, then they will be demolished,” said George.

A senior bureaucrat in the Urban Development Department said owners will have to produce some document to authenticate that the building was built before October 19, 2013.

“In case of unauthorised structures on agriculture (revenue) land, it is usually difficult to identify the day it was built but there will be some document such as water bill, electricity bill or gas connection to show that the building was built before October 19, 2013. We will accept them as a proof,” said the officer.

Ambiguity over GPA

There remains an ambiguity over the fate of properties where the owners still possess General Power of Attorney (GPA) although the buildings were constructed many years ago. In most of such cases, the seller of the property either refuses to register the property in the name of the person who holds the GPA or there is some legal hitch preventing the registration.

BBMP Commissioner N Manjunath Prasad said neither was there any discussion on this issue nor the Akrama Sakrama rules have any space for it. These structures, if not regularis-ed under the present Akrama Sakrama scheme, face the thr-eat of demolition once the four-month window period is over."

The state government, during the three-day event, will focus on exhibiting the state’s strengths in the industrial sector to attract investments. 

As many as 10 plenary sessions on various subjects will be held over two days. The first session will be on “Fueling growth through disruptive innovations startup ecosystem in Karnataka”  while the second session is on “Invest Karnataka: Innovate, Invent and Invest in Karnataka.”

Major Industries Minister R V Deshpande, who is coordinating between the state and the Centre for holding this mega event, said, “Pravasi Bharatiya Divas (PBD) is definitely not an occasion to sign agreements for attracting investments. But we have decided to exhibit the strengths of Karnataka to NRIs and foreigners. We want to drive home a point that Karnataka is the best destination to invest. Bengaluru has grown into Silicon Hill, and it is no more Silicon Valley.”

Nearly 3,000 delegates, including 1,700 NRIs, would be participating. Countries which are participating include Australia, Canada, UK, USA, France, the Netherlands and West Asian nations.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to arrive here on January 7 evening to inaugurate PBD the next day. Portugal Prime Minister Antonio Costa will be the chief guest for the inaugural session.

On January 9, President Pranab Mukherjee will present PBD Samman awards to 30 individuals who have excelled in their chosen profession. Karnataka has recommended six individuals for the awards.

However, the three-day event will begin a day before the inauguration by the prime minister. On January 7, Surinam Vice President Michael Ashwin Adhin will inaugurate the Youth PBD. The 36-year-old Adhin will address the gathering, comprising largely overseas young Indians.

"JAN 01 2017, 00:16 IST",Archives,"Tabeenah Anjum in Jaipur, Jan 01, 2017,",First wax museum in a heritage site,"Each exhibit  has an evocative backdrop or intricately designed set

A few cities in the country boast of wax museums. But the one in Jaipur is unique as it is the only one located in a heritage site in the country. The Jaipur Wax Museum is situated in the 18th century Nahargarh Fort nestled in one of  the world’s oldest mountain ranges, Aravalli. This would now be a must-visit spot in the tourists' paradise Rajasthan, which has historical monuments like Hawa Mahal, Jantar Mantar, several forts and palaces.

The museum houses among others statues of Rabindranath Tagore and Einstein. The museum with 32 exhibits, based on different themes, is located in the Shastraagaar and Vishraamghar sections of the fort. An initiative of the  Rajasthan Government, the entrance features a 11-foot-long Bullet motorbike called Gati Gamini.

The museum tour begins at the “Hall of Icons” where visitors come face to face with  life-size exhibits of national heroes and celebrities. Each exhibit  has an evocative backdrop or intricately designed set.

The prominent statues include that of Mahatma Gandhi, Subhash Chandra Bose, cricketer Sachin Tendulkar, former President APJ Abdul Kalam, tennis player Sania Mirza, woman boxer Mary Kom, Jaipur’s founder Sawai Jai Singh II, astronaut the late Kalpana Chawla, actor Deepika Padukone and Saint Mother Teresa.

Museum curator Anoop Srivastava told DH, “I have tried to restore the fort and its interiors. The effort has been to portray India’s history. It also attempts to provide an opportunity for visitors to see from close quarters the statues of their favourite Bollywood and Hollywood stars, world leaders, sports stars, pop singers, royal family members, cultural personalities, historical figures, political and contemporary leaders.”

An initiative by Entertainment 7 Creative Ventures Pvt Ltd, the museum is the brainchild of Anoop Srivastava, a filmmaker by profession who laid the intellectual foundation for this project with the Pink City Film Festival in 2006. 

The wax for the statues is derived from honey comb, whereas skeleton is made up of plastic fibre or silicon, and covered and designed with wax. A wax statue could cost anywhere between Rs 10 lakh and Rs 12 lakh and has to be housed in an air-conditioned room. The hall of icons also contains a special section for children where they can meet their favourite characters like Spiderman, Ironman, Doraemon and Nobita. 

Dandi March forms the backdrop of Gandhiji’s statue and likewise  Rabindranath Tagore teaching with scenic Shantiniketan and Kala Bhawan as the background. Interestingly, statue of Subhash Chandra Bose has a fire exit door showing how he had used “Chor Darwaza” to flee.  It is said that Bose would use tunnels and other secret routes to escape during raids by the British army.

 Abdul Kalam has Rashtrapati Bhavan as the backdrop with a wall having photos of all former presidents, and a shelf which has all the books written by him. The museum also has a separate corner for Bachchan family where wax statues of famous poet Harivansh Rai Bachchan, his son Amitabh Bachchan and grandson Abhishek Bachchan (whose statue is still in the making) are placed.

“I have been to different museums all over the world but this wax museum is different from others. Each statue has a story with it. It explains the history and concept apart from knowing the legends. I loved the entire ambiance,” said Lina Ray, a visitor and scholar from Germany.

The ground floor of the Vishraamghar (warrior’s rest area) within the Nahargarh Fort has been re-designed to resemble a charming royal courtroom from the 18th century. Aptly named The Royal Darbar, this grand courtroom displays wax and silicon statues of Rajasthan’s royal lineage of Maharajas and Maharanis in traditional costumes.

Visitors can also see traditional paintings, antique artifacts, a royal buggy and interactive statues. Legends like Rajmata Maharani Gayatri Devi in her unique outfit Chiffon saree and pearl necklace and seven-foot- three-inch-tall statue of Maharana Pratap  and shoe sized 15, and many others  grace the royal environs of the fort. It also holds a special exhibit called “The Journey of the Jaipur Gemstone.”

According to its makers, it took seven-and-a-half months to ready the museum. The artists who worked for over two years to make the wax statues are Susanta Ray (sculptor),  Wang Ping (special make up), Jiang (hair stylist), Bodh Singh Rajporia (costume stylist),  Johnson (production designer). They belong to West Bengal and China. Crystals have been used for eyes whereas original hair has been used for wig.  

The grandest and the most exquisite exhibit of the museum has been artfully installed at the top floor of the Vishraamghar is the “Sheesh Mahal” (palace of mirrors).  Here visitors can experience a life of royalty in full costume and real lifelike settings. A visitor will have to shell out Rs  5,000 per hour in Sheesh Mahal and an advance booking has to be made. This area has been redesigned into a magnificent mirror work splendour.

“Sheesh Mahal has a royal throne and dresses of the royal family. They can click their photos wearing those royal dresses. It has Thikri mirror work, a craft that dates back to many centuries. This enthralling mirror work has been put together by over 100 skilled craftsmen working day and night and displays about 2.5 million glass pieces , creating spectacular optical illusions,” adds  Rajiv Kohli, technical head of  the museum. With real gold and gem artwork, stunning crystal chandeliers and other precious trinkets, this Palace of Mirrors is a sight to behold.

However, art critics and artists believe that the museum is more a commercial venture and serves little purpose. H S Shiva Prakash, Professor, Centre for Arts and Aesthetics, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, said: “There is a need to spread the ideology of great men, instead of iconising history. Wax museums all over the world iconise but don't make any difference and efforts to spread their ideology.” Another noted sculptor of India, Himmat Shah, echoing the same views, said, “Wax museums have more of a commercial approach and less art in them. The statues are mostly replica. However, the concept is good and can add to the existing approach.”
The Archaeology and Tourism Department seems to love this as tourists footfall at the Nahargarh Fort had almost doubled. Superintendent Krishna Kanta Sharma told DH, “ Earlier, we used to have  1,500 tourists every day which has grown to over 2,500 and touching even 3,000 at times.” The entry ticket for Nahargarh is Rs 50 and for the museum Rs 400."
"JAN 01 2017, 00:18 IST",Archives,"R Sathyanarayana in Chennai, Jan 01, 2017,",He breathes life into statues,"When charismatic actor and Tamil Nadu chief minister the late M G Ramachandran died in 1987, Yuvaraj made a life-size statue of him. Similarly, after Missile Man and former Indian President Abdul Kalam's demise, Yuvaraj chiselled his statue.

The 50-year-old Yuvaraj sculpts statues of legends which almost look real.  Although Yuvaraj, with his late brother, had made scores of statues of  political leaders, saints such as Thiruvalluvar and poets, including Subramania Bharati, that have been installed in many states, only a few people know that his family has been involved in this artwork for over seven decades.    “I learnt this art at the age of 10 from my father and brother,” recalls Yuvaraj, who had set up his studio at Nungambakkam area in Chennai.

Whether the sculpture is made of bronze or fibre glass or cement or rubber, Yuvaraj says he will make sure that the faces and anatomy of the leaders come as they are. 

Yuvaraj's father Govindasamy was a popular sculptor in the late 60s when C N Annadurai was the chief minister of Tamil Nadu. During that time, Govindasamy was famous for sculpting politician, writer and statesman the late C Rajagopalachari, Saint Thiruvalluvar and the father of the nation Mahatma Gandhi at various government campuses in the state.

“My father first taught the art to my brother Mohandas when I was very young,” Yuvaraj said. A bright and artistic child, it was clear from an early age that Yuvaraj was destined for a career in art when he started making  small elephants in clay.

“It was not only recognised by my father but also by my brother,” Yuvaraj said.  “Since I was very young, my father would explain to me the art of sculpting,” he added. After a few years when Yuvaraj had started working on statues, his father passed away. “When my father died, I was disappointed as I would not get guidance from him,” Yuvaraj recollects.

However, there was no stopping Yuvaraj as he continued to learn sculpting from his brother when he was in the sixth standard. Initially, he helped his brother, who had taken over the mantle from his father.

“When I grew up, I and my brother, who was already in the profession, started sculpting statues of various leaders together. We have worked on the MGR statue near Spencer Plaza and the one of Rajaji at Parry’s Corner (both in Chennai) in the late 80s,” Yuvaraj said. “Both the statues were very well received,” he added.

Though the duo received only a few thousand rupees a month from their profession, they were satisfied with their family business. “Our sculptures were seen as great works. But the money what we got was not big,” Yuvaraj said.
He said that sculpting a statue takes a minimum 15 to 20 days. “The difficult part is to make the face as it is in the photograph. If something goes wrong, we have to do it all over again,” he said.  Some works had taken more than five weeks.

When life was going on smoothly, he suffered another blow as his main mentor and brother Mohandas died. With more responsibility, Yuvaraj took the family occupation and started making statues  with a few labourers. “After my brother passed away, the task of carrying on the family tradition rested with me and his son,” Yuvaraj said. “Therefore, I expanded my studio and I employed six workers, who help me,” he said.

Yuvaraj could not resist talking about his wife's influence on him. “Without my wife's encouragement, I wouldn't have come this far. She does not want me to give up family profession and take up some other work to earn more money,” he said.

Though Yuvaraj has won many laurels along with his brother, he was very happy when he received a call from DMK president M Karunanidhi's office, where he was asked to sculpt Annadurai statue at Anna Centenary Library in 2011. Soon after installing it, Yuvaraj received compliments from Karunanidhi and several leaders for his work. Yuvaraj still remembers that he was very satisfied with his job when he sculpted the statue of Gandhi for the secretariat building at Thiruvananthapuram in Kerala.

“It was a great feeling when several political leaders from Kerala appreciated me. I will never be able to forget that day,” Yuvaraj said. Yuvaraj and his brother's work could be seen on the Parliament campus where Annadurai's statue has been installed. Besides, another statue of Annadurai has been put up at Tamil Nadu House in New Delhi.

Making several Abdul Kalam's statues for schools, colleges and university campus also made Yuvaraj happy. “Still I am getting orders from various schools to create Kalam sir's statues. I am very much satisfied as I have done his statues in bronze, cement, marble and even in fibre glass,” he said. Now, Yuvaraj is nurturing his younger son, who will complete his schooling. “I was worried when my elder son, who is doing an engineering course, did not show any interest in the family profession. However, I was relieved when my younger son started showing interest in sculpting,” he added.

Yuvaraj is planning to train students, who are interested in taking up his profession. “A lot of  youngsters are showing interest in sculpting and  approaching me. It shows that this profession has a long life and will be passed on to future generations,” Yuvaraj said. He is apprehensive as the profession is not financially rewarding. “People can take up this activity only if they thoroughly love it. If they think about money then there is no place for them,” Yuvaraj said.

After the sudden demise of chief minister J Jayalalithaa, Yuvaraj has been getting calls even from Delhi to make the AIADMK leader's statue. “Though I got orders, I am planning to do a 10-foot-tall Jayalalithaa's statue for my own use since I am a die-hard fan of her. I will be installing it inside my studio,” he said."
"JAN 01 2017, 00:21 IST",Archives,"Sunil Raghu in Ahmedabad, Jan 01, 2017,","Bowling the right length, hitting it straight, always","Cricketer Jigna Gajjar quit the game after marriage as she found it difficult to continue with the game. “However, the cricketer in me was always alive and kept pushing me to continue but I could not,” says Jigna Gajjar, a former West Zone player who represented Gujarat.

Nothing new, one would say. Especially when it sadly comes to women's cricket. While the story of most of her teammates in women cricket is no different, Jigna was made of different mettle. Today, this right-arm medium fast bowler imparts professional coaching to children in the age group of 10 years to 20 years.

Again nothing new, one can say. However, therein lies a key difference.  The difference is that Jigna imparts her cricketing skills to children from the economically weaker section and living in slums.

“I have children whose parents are either tea vendors, rickshaw drivers or labourers. They all study in municipality-run government schools and the coaching I give is completely free,” Jigna says.

Jigna is proud of one statistics in her cricketing career—she has never bowled a no ball or a wide ball. She had to struggle a lot in the beginning of her coaching career. She persisted and moved around schools to meet teachers and children’s parents to allow their wards to attend coaching.

“Many came as it was for free but I have a very strict criterion. I am putting in my time and efforts, so I insist that they too put in equal efforts. They need to be punctual not just to cricket practice but in their schooling. They have to attend school. But that is not enough, above all they need to have aptitude to play cricket. I am also a stickler for discipline. I have had to ask about three of my students to leave as they did not adhere to discipline,” Jigna says.

And it is not just free coaching that she imparts to children, she shells out money to hire the ground for coaching as well as tournaments. “The other big problem of working with kids from poor economic background is the complete lack of nutrition. If they have Rs five, they would buy a wafer or a biscuit. I try to teach them that instead they should buy a banana every day and eat. I also try to take fruits for my students. But their fitness and agility remain a big challenge,” Jigna rues.

Jigna’s tryst with cricket began rather late in her life. Though her mother and father were avid cricket followers, none of her family members had played professional cricket. Her father was a teacher and mother a homemaker and she was a “huge” fan of India’s all-rounder great Kapil Dev. Still Jigna had to sulk and cry her heart out for over two days to convince her parents to take up coaching.

“It was in the third year of my graduation around 2003. I attended college in the mornings and was part of a theatre group. One day I got delayed during rehearsals and while  moving out, I saw girls in my college at cricket coaching. I was surprised to know that my college offered professional coaching to girls. I had to immediately join in,” Jigna says.

Once she had convinced her parents, Jigna never looked back and went on to represent the state team. But everything changed in 2008, when she married. It was not her in-laws who pressurised her to quit the game she loved.  She continued to play cricket in tournaments for over a year but felt torn between her cricketing career and domestic duties and quit.

“My husband is an interior designer. He and my in-laws have always encouraged me to continue but I somehow could not manage both domestic and cricketing fronts. So when I decided to coach slum children, my in-laws supported me. Today I am able to coach only due to complete financial support from my husband and in-laws, who help pay ground hiring charges, food and other expenses for my students,” Jigna adds.

For over three years, Jigna has been hiring and hitting the ground three times a week, training over 40 children, including 13 girls, in the nitty-gritty of cricket, without a break.

“I want to train them from Monday to Friday but sadly my family and I have limited resources that we can utilise but I have no complaints as this has become my life,” she added. She now hopes that one of her wards would achieve success in cricket that she only aspired to.

“My biggest regret in life has been that I could never don Indian colours. But I am hopeful and living my dream through my students. Though coaching these children gives me pleasure equal to representing my country in cricket, my biggest hope now is to see at least one of my children play for India someday,”  she says."
"JAN 01 2017, 00:27 IST",Specials,"Sanjay Pandey, Jan 01, 2017, DHNS,",SP hara-kiri alters UP pollscape,"The raging feud in the Samajwadi Party (SP) bringing Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav and his father and party supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav face-to-face which almost left the party on the brink of a split may have come to a temporary halt. But it has severely dented the image of the party and is likely to alter the electoral equations in Uttar Pradesh where Assembly polls are scheduled to be held in the next couple of months.

Political observers in Lucknow feel that the infighting within the SP family may impact its core “M-Y” (Muslim-Yadav) vote bank and trigger a churning in the two communities affecting all the major players in the state. This may force them to “alter” their electoral strategies in accordance with the new political equations.

The turf war within Mulayam’s ‘political family’, which has been going on for the past five months, has witnessed sacking of key ministers, including Mulayam’s brother Shivpal Singh Yadav, and expulsions of Akhilesh and his uncle Ram Gopal, and their subsequent revocation in a matter of 24 hours.

“The SP battle has triggered a confusion in its vote bank...party workers find themselves sandwiched between father-son duo...it does not augur well for the party,” said senior Lucknow-based journalist and political analyst Mudit Mathur.

While the Congress and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) may be eyeing a golden opportunity, the BJP faces a dilemma as it may have to rework its electoral plank. The BJP’s biggest worry seems to be the Muslim vote bank of the SP. Muslims, who account for around 20% of the state’s electorate, play a crucial role in more than 125 of the 403 Assembly constituencies.

“It remains to be seen who will get the Muslims support...so far they have solidly backed Mulayam...the SP feud may force them to shift allegiance to the BSP,” a senior state BJP leader told DH. BSP supremo Mayawati, who enjoys the support of around 21% Dalit voters, has already been wooing the Muslims knowing well that their support could once again catapult her party to power. Mayawati has been asking the Muslims not to “waste” their votes by supporting the SP. “A series of communal riots has taken place during the SP regime…the minority community is not safe,” Mayawati had said.

The BSP has already deputed its senior leader Naseemuddin Siddqique and Haji Yaqoob Qureshi to garner support of the community in the western region, where Muslims are in sizeable numbers in several Assembly seats. “The BJP will be the biggest loser if the Muslims shift loyalty to Mayawati…she will have the winning combination in that case,” said Mathur. But columnist and political analyst Masood Ahmed said: “Muslims will support Akhilesh...there is a feeling in the community that Akhilesh is in a better position to counter the BJP in the state”. According to him, Muslims are likely to vote “tactically” and support the candidate who is better placed to defeat the BJP.

Akhilesh has also, in his list of Assembly polls nominees, fielded a number of Muslim candidates from western Uttar Pradesh. Within the SP, too, a large number of senior Muslim leaders, including those who had been with Mulayam for several decades, have extended support to Akhilesh, giving a jolt to the SP supremo and Shivpal.

Senior state minister and firebrand Muslim leader Azam Khan, ministers Ahmed Hasan and Kamal Akhtar have pledged support to Akhilesh. Azam, in fact, played the role of a mediator and persuaded Mulayam to patch-up with Akhilesh and revoke his expulsion.

The Yadav votes

Another churning may take place in the SP’s Yadav vote bank. Yadavs, who comprise around 16% of the total electorate, are a dominant force in more than 150 seats across Uttar Pradesh, especially in the central and eastern region.

Mathur says that a large chunk of Yadav votes would go to Akhilesh if he breaks away from Mulayam. “During the past four years, Akhilesh has emerged as the face of the SP...the youths from the community see in him the future leader, who has everything to inherit the legacy of Mulayam,” he said. An Akhilesh supporter said: “Akhilesh wants to send a message to the community members that he will not go against Mulayam, who is held in great respect by the Yadavs, especially the elder ones.” Within Mulayam’s political family, many senior leaders have sided with Akhilesh. Mulayam’s cousin Ram Gopal, his son Akshoy, nephew and MP Dharmendra and grand-nephew Tej Pratap are with Akhilesh. State unit president Shivpal Yadav and his son Aditya, however, are siding with Mulayam.

Political analysts, however, also feel that there might be a division in the Yadav votes which would ultimately damage both factions of the SP and benefit the rivals. A sulking Shivpal may play the spoilsport. A senior SP leader said: “Shivpal has many loyalists within the party organisation and he may ask them to lie low, impacting the SP’s electoral prospects, especially in the party strongholds of Etawah, Auraiya, Mainpuri and some other districts.”

As Akhilesh emerged on top in the SP battle, the changed political scene has increased the hopes of an alliance between the Congress, Akhilesh, the Rashtriya Lok Dal and the JD(U). The Congress, which had outrightly rejected reports of an alliance, now says that it was keeping a watch on the situation. State Congress leaders, however, now feel that the party will gain electorally if it strikes an alliance with Akhilesh. “It will not only check the division of Muslim votes, but the Yadavs will also support Akhilesh, as the possibility of him returning to power will enhance manifold,” said a senior state Congress leader.

Akhilesh, who had been in favour of an alliance with the Congress, had not announced his candidates on a majority of the seats that were won by the latter in the 2012 Assembly elections. Mulayam had closed all avenues of an alliance by announcing SP nominees on the Assembly seats where the Congress had emerged victorious last time.

The BJP leaders said that they are keeping a watch on the political situation. “Nothing can be predicted about the attitude of the SP supporters,” said a state BJP leader. A source in the BJP said the process of selecting nominees for the Assembly polls might now be delayed. “We will have to wait and seen if new alliances are struck and change our strategy accordingly,” the BJP leader added.

 With the Assembly polls barely a few weeks away, it will be interesting to see how the fast changing political equations alters the electoral landscape."

However, by November-end it became clear the “surgical strike on black money” that riled the aam admi and traders (the BJP’s traditional supporters) may electorally backfire.

As the BJP top brass went into brainstorming huddles to minimise the damage, Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Mulayam Singh Yadav’s “surgical strike” on his son and Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav by expelling him from the party for six years came as a booster shot for the saffron party. However, the delight did not last long as the father-son duo buried the hatchet in 24 hours.

Though a split has been averted in the SP, selection of candidates continues to be an area of friction. The fratricidal feud in the Yadav ‘khandaan’  and the frequent U-turns by its top leadership on the eve of election has given the BJP at least a psychological advantage as of now.

In any case, a three-way split in the Opposition camp is advantageous to the BJP. The scenario could still change if the SP, Congress, Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) and the JD(U) forge an electoral alliance that could form the nucleus of an anti-BJP front with the Muslim-Yadav core. That is, if Mulayam plays the ball. The RLD can pitch in with its Jat votes, JD(U) chief Nitish Kumar can help influence his fellow Kurmis (9% of population), while the Congress bags some Muslim, Dalit and Brahmin votes.

All these parties are headed by secular leaders talking of development. Interestingly, Twitter is abuzz with claims that an internal mail from Akilesh’s US advisor, Steve Jarding, has been leaked and that “the US coach suggests war in the SP is orchestrated to project CM as the development icon.” It remains to be seen who will have the last laugh.

BJP president Amit Shah and BSP supremo Mayawati are not sitting idle either. Shah has set up high-voltage election machinery with IT and IIT professionals to micro-manage the polls. Top saffron strategists are also working on the possibility of reaching a covert understanding with Mulayam (who controls party’s purse strings) while fielding candidates to contain the Congress and the BSP. They are also surreptitiously working to pre-empt alliances between rival parties and fronts. This strategy, coupled with social engineering, may help the party win the polls, sources claim.

In the 2012 polls, the SP secured 29.15% votes and wrested power from the BSP winning 224 seats. The BSP secured 25.91% (just 4% less votes than the SP) but bagged only 80 seats. The Congress secured 11.6% votes and 28 seats. The BJP got 47 seats and 15% vote share. Arithmetically speaking, the SP plus Congress or a BSP-Congress alliance could have been formidable to take on the BJP.

Mayawati has the core Dalit base and a chunk of Brahmin votes and if Muslim voters consolidate behind the BSP, it could tilt the balance. Besides, her tested persona as a tough administrator, especially on the law and order front, is a plus point. The BJP can steal a march over its rivals if it manages to woo the non-Yadavs, the non-Jatav Dalits and the upper castes. The party has several advantages – ruling party at the Centre, flush with funds, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s so called reformer image, party’s well-oiled election machinery and 71 sitting Lok Sabha MPs.
 
Cashlessness sets in

Nevertheless, the Muslims continue to be the BJP’s Achilles heel in the heartland state. If the minority community goes for tactical voting, that is electing the strongest anti-BJP party or front, it may consolidate either behind the SP or BSP as events unfold. Mayawati is trying to cash in on the demonetisation fiasco and the unpredictable nature of SP leaders, and is nudging Muslims to close ranks behind her.
To scare them, the BSP strategists have been propagating that Akilesh’s uncle Shivpal Yadav and general secretary Amar Singh having reached some covert understanding with the BJP. There was even speculation whether Modi may prop up Mulayam Singh Yadav as the President when incumbent Pranab Mukherjee demits office in July, though the RSS is unlikely to back a “socialist” candidate.

The Muslims constitute roughly 19% of voters and are in a position to influence around 300 out of the 403 Assembly constituencies. While it was a cakewalk for the BJP in 2014 when it won 71 out of the 80 Lok Sabha seats, 32 months later, the party seems to be losing voters’ confidence and is also reeling under the negative effects of demonetisation.

Nearly, 35% voters comprising Muslims, Yadavs and Jatavs can be counted out of the BJP’s kitty, while the remaining 65% is not a homogenous configuration. The BJP has the support of 8% Rajputs, besides just over 30% of Most Backward Castes. The 13% Brahmins, a bit alienated from the party, are being aggressively wooed by both the BSP and the Congress.

The BJP’s main drawback is that it does not have a chief ministerial candidate of the stature of Mayawati or Akhilesh. It has since lost a substantial chunk of its support base in the rural areas due to the bad implementation of the demonetisation agenda. A team of party MPs who visited the rural areas recently have given a negative feedback and have urged the leadership to take immediate steps to restore voter confidence.

All eyes are now on the budget next month when the government is expected to offer some sops for the aam admi and the middle-class to paper over the ill-effects of demonetisation after some announcements made by Modi on Saturday.

"JAN 01 2017, 00:41 IST",Specials,"J P Shukla, Jan 01, 2017,","With Mulayam's house in disarray, Muslims may veer towards BSP","The Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) is closely watching the developments unfolding inside its arch-rival Samajwadi Party (SP).

Prior to the latest development, demonetisation seemed to have overtaken all other issues in the caste-ridden politics of Uttar Pradesh in the run-up to the Assembly elections.

Arguably, the note ban crisis should make or mar only the prospects of the BJP whose government at the Centre was responsible for the decision. The people’s satisfaction may help the BJP, while their anger may benefit the Opposition in proportion to the share of their support among the voters.

The BSP, claiming to be the natural alternative of the ruling SP and considered to be a major beneficiary of the so-called “ five-year misrule”, is placed in an unenviable situation. This because of the disclosures made by the Enforcement Directorate that old currency notes worth several crores of  rupees were deposited in the accounts of the party and Anand Kumar, BSP supremo Mayawati’s brother, immediately after demonetisation was announced. Mayawati has claimed that everything was done in accordance with the existing rules and there was nothing illegal in deposits either in the accounts of her own party or that of her brother. She, however, finds it hard to evade the controversy.

Mayawati has been prone to pointing out to her Dalit vote bank that political parties dominated by the upper castes never wanted a “Dalit ki beti” to prosper and raised all kinds of charges to defame her. The BSP said the charges that cash deposits were illegally made in the accounts of her party and her brother reflected a casteist and anti-Dalit mindset of the BJP and its leaders. The BJP had used similar tactics earlier to malign her image with the disproportionate assets case and the Taj Corridor issue, Mayawati argued.

That Mayawati has been forced to target the BJP, instead of her main rival SP, makes her discomfiture evident. There must be ample ammunition in her armoury to target the SP for its misrule, but it may be of little use. She has been compelled to protect herself against bantering accusations made by her BJP rivals that she is a “daulat ki beti” (daughter of wealth) and not daughter of a Dalit as she claims.

Several BSP MLAs, including former leader of the Opposition in the Assembly Swami Prasad Maurya, resigned from her party to join the BJP in the recent past. Most of them made allegations that Mayawati demanded huge amounts of cash to distribute tickets to contest elections from her party. The allegations have come in handy to her critics to reason out why large amounts of cash were deposited in her party account after demonetisation.

The BSP has, however, found unexpected solace in the open rift in the SP. The differences between the rival factions – one led by Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav and the other by his uncle and state party chief Shivpal Yadav – which had been intermittently showing up, led to Akhilesh’s expulsion from the party, but it was later revoked. Both camps had announced separate list of candidates to contest the upcoming Assembly elections which led to Akhilesh’s expulsion.

The minority vote

The BSP would naturally be eyeing the Muslims, the main support base of the SP besides the Yadavs.

The minorities may not be convinced by the latest compromise between the
father and son, and the BSP hopes that they will veer towards their party. With the future still tense for the SP, the ruling party would naturally give a weak challenge to the BJP. And the Muslim voters who want a non-BJP government in Uttar Pradesh may find the BSP as the only solid choice, which will be a windfall for Mayawati.

The BSP cadres have taken due note of the fact and gone ahead with their strategy to hold meetings in minority-dominated areas. People belonging to the weaker sections, such as the Dalits, daily-wage earners, petty shop keepers etc., have been the worst hit by demonetisation.

Whether they are convinced with the BJP’s argument that the discomfort was worth taking to ward off the menace of black money is not clear. The impact of a Dalit-Muslim combine in support of the BSP would largely depend on the people’s general perception. The same can be true about the traditional support of the Brahmins and traders community to the BJP. The situation at present is in a flux.

Now, Kumari S Aishwarya is not a stranger to Benglauru’s connoisseurs of music. Great granddaughter of Dr  M S Subbulakshmi, Aishwarya is just 21 years young and is a student of BA. She is continuing her music lessons under Smt Jambu Kannan, apart from her grandmother Radha Vishwanathan and also taking guidance from Dr Nagaraj Hawaldar.

M S Subbulakshmi's daughter Radha Vishwanathan received the Veene Raja Rao Memorial National Award on Wednesday. Her granddaughter Aishwarya gave a vocal concert after the award ceremony.

Aishwarya prayed Dakshina Murthy in the beginning and sought blessings, followed by the familiar varna “Ninukori.” “Vachamagochara” was another fine selection. For a detailed elaboration, she chose Kalyani, the ever-green raga. Though it is a commonly heard raga, she made it interesting with lively phrases.

The choice of “Nambi Kettavarillavo,” the stately devaranama of Purandara Dasa, anchored well to the lilting gait to leave a lingering effect. With crisp nerval (Garudagamana Sri Purandara Vittalana) and swara prasthara, the Dasara Pada was wholesome. With a prelude of Ugabhoga (Ninnane Paaduve) the “Naneke Badavanu Naneke Paradeshi,” popularised by M S - is also a favourite of music lovers.

B Raghuram on violin, Anoor Ananthakrishna Sharma on mridanga and Sunad Anoor on khanjari supported with good understanding. Though there is a long way to go, Aishwarya, with her good voice and good training, has a bright future in the years to come.
 
Hindustani vocal

The Sapthak presented two concerts - a vocal and another instrumental concert, in collaboration with Sri Akhila Havyaka Mahasabha under the banner “Shubha Sangeetha Sandhya.” Sri Kiran Hegde gave a melodious flute accompanied by Udayraj Karpur.

Kumar Mardur, who gave a Hindustani vocal recital, hails from a musicians family of northern Karnataka. He learnt from his father Somnath Mardur and is taking guidance from Pandith Ullas Kashalkar. He is on the staff of SRA, Kolkata, as a junior faculty member.

As Kumar Mardur meditatively started to intonate Rageshree his searching mind surfaced. Though it is not a rare raga, we are not hearing it frequently. A facile, tuneful voice enabled Mardur to sing with ease. Rag Saraswathi was compact but pleasing and concluded with a meaningful bhajan of Kabir Das. He was supported by Keshav Joshi on tabla and Sateesh Kolli on harmonium. With some more concert experience, Kumar Mardur will be able to reach great heights."

Investors started taking profit in recent gainers that made mood downbeat.

There was accelerated selling after manufacturing sector contracted in December, hit hard by demonetisation, and fresh weakness in the rupee. The Nikkei Markit India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 49.6, down from 52.3 in November.

Opening on a weak note, the Sensex shuttled between 26,720.98 and 26,447.06 and settled lower 31.01 points, or 0.12 per cent, at 26,595.45.

Other losers were Infosys, GAIL, Cipla, Wipro, HUL, NTPC and TCS.

Most global stocks, including those in Asia and Europe, were closed today for the New year.

The near-absence of overseas cues meant investors remained directionless.

In contrast, investors indulged widening their portfolios in the second-line stocks, with small-cap and mid-cap indices outperforming the Sensex with gains of 1.20 per cent and 0.83 per cent, respectively.

Bajaj Auto fell 1 per cent after company reported a 22 per cent decline in total sales in December while Hero MotoCorp fell 0.53 per cent.

On the other hand, largest car-maker Maruti Suzuki gained 2.69 per cent even as it reported 1 per cent decline in total sales in December 2016.

M&M rose 3.42 per cent after the company reported 9 per cent increase in total tractor sales at 14,047 units in December while Tata Motors climbed 3.37 per cent.

Stocks of realty companies caught buyers' fancy after Prime Minister Narendra Modi on December 31 announced that loans of up to Rs 9 lakh taken in the new year under the new scheme of Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana will receive interest subvention of 4 per cent and loan of up to Rs 12 lakh will get a 3 per cent waiver.

"JAN 02 2017, 14:25 IST",Business,"New Delhi, Jan 2, 2017, PTI,",Manufacturing slips into contraction on cash crunch: PMI data,"Hit hard by the demonetisation move, manufacturing sector plunged into contraction in December -- the first shrinkage in a year -- as cash crunch took its toll on new business orders and factory output, a monthly survey showed today.

The Nikkei Markit India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) -- which measures manufacturing sector activity -- fell to 49.6, down from 52.3 in November.

The index slipped below the crucial 50 threshold -- which separates contraction from expansion -- for the first time since December 2015. This also marked the biggest month-on- month decline in the index in over eight years or since November 2008 when the global economy had slipped into a severe downturn post Lehman collapse.

""Having held its ground in November, following the unexpected withdrawal of Rs 500 and 1,000 bank notes from circulation, India's manufacturing industry slid into contraction at the end of 2016,"" said Pollyanna De Lima, Economist at IHS Markit and author of the report.

Lima added that ""cash flow issues among firms also led to reductions in purchasing activity and employment"".

Survey participants widely blamed the withdrawal of high-value rupee notes for the downturn as cash shortage in the economy reportedly resulted in fewer levels of new orders.

Businesses also highlighted challenging conditions in external markets, with a fall in new businesses from abroad ending a six-month long growth.

Though December saw a mild decline in manufacturing output, the average reading for October-December remained in the ""growth terrain"", suggesting a positive contribution from the sector to overall GDP in the third quarter of 2016-17, the survey said.

Several researchers and economists have lowered their near-term GDP growth forecasts in the wake of the demonetisation move, though there is a broader view that the decision would help the economy grow faster in longer run.

""With the window for exchanging notes having closed at the end of December, January data will be key in showing whether the sector will see a quick rebound,"" Lima added.

The report said the higher prices paid for a range of raw materials made average cost burden increase for the 15th straight month in December, with the rate of inflation picking up since November."
"JAN 02 2017, 18:25 IST",Business,"Mumbai, Jan 2, 2017, PTI,","SBI pushes merger of 5 associate banks, BMB to next fiscal","State Bank chairperson Arundhati Bhattacharya today hinted that the mega merger of its five associate banks and Bharatiya Mahila Bank (BMB) could be pushed to the next financial year as it is still awaiting the government notification on the move.

""Probably, by a quarter or so (the merger could be delayed). The reason is we still have to get the government approval and even if we get it now, doing things like merger in the last quarter is never a very wise thing because there would be lot of IT system changes,"" she told reporters when asked whether the merger could be delayed due to the disruptions caused by the demonetisation drive.

The merger would make SBI a global-sized bank and would be amongst the top 50 lenders in the world, with an asset base of Rs 37 trillion or over USD 555 billion, with 22,500 branches and over 58,000 ATMs and more than 50 crore customers.

Bhattacharya said normally the banks close down all the IT system changes by mid-February. ""Sometimes IT system can impact something else quite unknowingly. So we don't want to take any risks at the annual closing time. So we may want to do the annual closing and then look at it,"" she added.

When asked whether she has a new time in mind for the merger process to be completed, the chairperson said ""no yet. Let me first get the government approval only then we will know.""

When specifically asked what sort of government approval is pending, the chairperson said the government has ""to notify the merger scheme.""

It can be noted that the bank had announced the merger in May and its central board of directors had in August approved the process along with the share swap ratio for three of the listed associate banks and Bharatiya Mahila Bank.

At that time it was announced that the merger would be completed by end March 2017.

""The (merger) process will start by October-end. The grievance committee will come to us hopefully by September end, after that we have to send it to RBI and then to the government, which may probably take a little time of about month; and then it will come to us. After that we will have to make an offer to employees and then give them four weeks time and then the merger can take place,"" Bhattacharya had told PTI in an interview in September.

SBI has three listed associate banks - State Bank of Bikaner & Jaipur (SBBJ), State Bank of Mysore (SBM), State Bank of Travancore (SBT) and two unlisted associate bank - State Bank of Patiala and State Bank of Hyderabad.

As per the swap ratio, SBBJ shareholders would get 28 shares of SBI (Rs 1 each) for every 10 shares (Rs 10 each).

Similarly, SBM and SBT shareholders would  get 22 shares of SBI for every 10 shares.

In case of Bharatiya Mahila Bank, 4,42,31,510 shares of SBI would be swapped for every 100 crore of Rs 10 each.

The lender had put in place a grievance redressal mechanism to provide an opportunity to its shareholders to file their objections with regard to the share swap ratios. It had given 21 calendar days of time for shareholders to register their complaints.

The grievance committee was headed by a High Court judge and two chartered accountants.

Bhattacharya said post the merger of five associate banks and Bharatiya Mahila Bank, the government's stake in the bank would stand at around 59 per cent.

SBI has around 16,500 branches, including 191 foreign offices spread across 36 countries. Globally, SBI will come at the 45th position in terms of asset size after the merger.

SBI first merged State Bank of Saurashtra with itself in 2008. Two years later, State Bank of Indore was merged."

""I expect almost 35 new planes to join the Air India family during 2017 and all of us need to be in full readiness to receive them, fill them and fly them,"" the Air India CMD said in a New Year message to the employees.

With the addition of the new aircraft, the group would have a fleet of more than 170 planes.

Currently, the group has around 140 aircraft.

While Air India has 106 planes, its low cost international arm Air India Express has 23 aircraft. Besides, there are around 10 planed with Alliance Air, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the national carrier that operates in regional routes.

""2017 is going to be a year of consolidation and expansion.

""We are going to fly to many new international destinations and also connect new domestic destinations as part of the regional connectivity thrust of the government,"" Lohani said, adding that fill more and fly more is the motto.

For the first time in nearly a decade, Air India eked out an operational profit of Rs 105 crore, mainly helped by lower fuel costs and increased passenger numbers.

According to Lohani, public perception about the airline is showing an improving trend, which is getting visible, ""even if marginally in all our performance related indices"".

However, raising concerns about instances of misconduct among the staff, he also urged employees not to do anything that can come in the path of restoring Air India to its original glory.

""It pains me when I am made privy to acts of misconduct or witness some employees not displaying adherence to the highest standards of integrity,"" he noted.

The bank has reduced marginal cost of funds based lending rate (MCLR) by 0.7 per cent to 8.20 per cent for 1-year tenure, ICICI Bank said in a statement.

Similar cut has been made effective in other tenures, the bank said.

""The revised MCLR benchmarks effective from January 3,"" the bank said.

The reduction in interest rate will bring down interest rate on home and other loans linked to one-year MCLR by similar percentage point.

The one-year MCLR of SBI was reduced to 8 per cent from 8.90 per cent yesterday.
Banks are cutting lending rates after spurt in deposits following demonetisation of old high denomination currency notes of Rs 500/1,000.

The reduction in lending rate may prompt increase in credit offtake which has moderated substantially putting burden on balancesheet of banks.

Besides ICICI Bank, other lenders like Kotak Mahindra Bank, Dena Bank, Bandhan Bank, Andhra Bank and Oriental Bank of Commerce also slashed MCLR.

Yesterday, SBI, PNB and Union Bank of India had reduced MCLR rate.

Banks have switched to MCLR as their new benchmark lending rate from June last year, replacing the base rate system for new borrowers. It is calculated on the marginal cost of borrowing and return on net worth for banks. It was introduced by RBI to ensure fair interest rates to borrowers as well as banks.

MCLR also seeks to address the regulator's primary objective of expediting monetary policy transmission along with augmenting uniformity and transparency in the calculation methodology of lending rates. MCLR rates are revised every month."

""We must remember that operational excellence is an imperative for each one of us. We must focus on delivering the best solutions in the smartest, fastest way possible, and not give up or give in to weaker instincts,"" Sikka has said in a letter to employees.

""Often teams deliver only what is told without going beyond the given scope and with a lackadaisical attitude towards greater value creation.This can no longer be the case.""

He noted that teams have begun to understand and execute on the duality of automation and innovation and to bring value to clients ""not just mechanically execute the jobs we are handed,"" adding, ""there is a long way to go, and the road ahead is long and not easy.""

He said ""the mountains ahead are tall ones. But there is no other way but to get there and go...if we don't, we will be made obsolete by the tidal wave of automation and technology-fuelled transformation that is almost upon us.""

""On the other hand if we do achieve all that we set out to do, we can be that one force powering the purposeful evolution of our world. A world where our AIs may make us more successful, but also more human....."" he added.

Reflecting on the year gone by, Sikka said ""Brexit, the American Presidential election, demonetization, cyber security, the refugee and terrorism situation were the events that seriously changed the way we viewed the world, but perhaps that biggest disruption is the one that has been proceeding irreversibly and unstoppably in our times is the accelerating force of technology and digitization.""

Suggesting that by all indications, the future promises to be even more disruptive, especially for Infosys's business, which is impacted by the multiple factors of technological and geopolitical disruption, he said ""we will not survive if we remain in the constricted space of doing as we are told, depending solely on cost-arbitrage, and working as reactive problem-solvers.""

""By standing still, instead of moving forward decisively, we will face the brunt of these disruptive forces, as our industry has already started to see. A lot of the work that came to us and to others in our industry, can already be done with Al systems,"" he said.

Krishna Kishore, 21, a third-year student at Dayananda Sagar College of Engineering, and Santhosh, 20, a second-year student at Vemana Institute of Technology, both from Viveknagar, are the deceased, police said.

There were a total of six students in the car — the other four being Aditya, Supreet, Abhay and Wilton. Krishna was at the wheel while Santhosh was sitting next to him. The group had gone to Devanahalli on a joyride and was heading back to the city when the accident happened.

Krishna accelerated as the car neared Palanahalli Gate around 7.15 am. In the process, he lost control of the vehicle and it ploughed into the median strip before jumping to the other side of the road where there was oncoming traffic.

The car — a Maruti Swift — then collided with an airport-bound cab — a Mahindra Logan — injuring its driver, Manjunath, and a passenger, police said. The collision was so severe that the front portion of Maruti Swift was mangled and Krishna died on the spot. The four friends who were seated at the back miraculously escaped unhurt with only two of them sustaining minor bruises.

Addressing his first press conference as Bengaluru’s top cop, Sood said, “Our topmost priority is the safety of women, children and senior citizens. We will strive hard to ensure they feel safe and secure. Traffic is another important factor that needs attention.”

He warned of crackdown on anti-social elements and said a meeting with senior police officers would be held soon to suggest quick measures to check crimes and other illegal activities. He also promised citizen-centric measures. “Several initiatives are already in place. We’ll enforce them more effectively. People should not shy away from filing complaints as that will help us check crimes,” he said.

Asked about the involvement of several policemen in criminal activities recently, Sood said, “The previous commissioner (N S Megharikh) did an excellent job by terminating such people from service. Such kind of behaviour will not be tolerated.”

Traffic solutions
Sood has promised to instruct traffic police not to flag down vehicles for checking motorists’ driving licence and other documents. “Motorists will be stopped only when they commit an offence or drive drunk. They would do well to follow lane discipline and traffic rules.”  Sood, who was Bengaluru’s additional commissioner of police (traffic and security) from 2008 to February 2011, has promised better traffic management.

SMS updates on FIRs
The top cop acknowledged the inconvenience faced by the public in getting updates on FIRs. “It’s true that a complainant has to frequently visit the police station to get an update on their FIR or complaint. They set aside their personal work to visit the police station and end up wasting precious time. We will introduce a system under which once an FIR is registered, the complainant will get an instant SMS. They will also get text messages on the status of the FIRs. This will also help us as we can focus on investigation and the related matters,” Sood explained.

Harnessing social media
Sood also emphasised the use of technology in policing. “The Bengaluru police are a role model for law-enforcement forces of other states in using social media like Twitter, Facebook and WhatsApp. We will keep using these platforms extensively to bring the public and police closer. With criminals also going tech-savvy, we need to be one step ahead of them,” he said.

Passport verification
The police commissioner said his target was to reduce the passport verification time to 15 days. “For now, our target is 15 days and we plan to bring it down to 10 days. If an applicant is not available on weekdays, they have to visit the police station in a given time. If they are still not available, we’ll send their documents to the department concerned. We do not want any pendency,” he said.

The fog delayed 78 flights departing from KIA and eight flights arriving at the airport. Such disruptions are likely to continue as the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has forecast dense fog for at least four more days.

A Blue Dart aviation flight from New Delhi, a British Airways flight from London and an Air Asia flight had to be diverted to airports in neighbouring cities. Operations were suspended at 4.45 am and resumed at 8.49 am.

Four departures and arrivals each of Indigo Airlines had to be cancelled due to the fog. One Jet Airways flight departing from and another arriving at KIA were also
cancelled.

The morning disruption had a cascading effect on flight schedules in the afternoon. Passengers had to wait for hours in the departure lounges.

Over the last week, hundreds of flights have been disrupted due to dense fog.

According to predictions by the IMD, conditions of fog early in the morning will persist till January 5 with minimum temperatures hovering between 14 and 15 degrees Celsius. The fog will clear later in the day. However, the skies, IMD says, will be mainly clear on January 6 and 7."

"JAN 02 2017, 01:06 IST",City,"Reshma Ravishanker Bengaluru, Jan 02, 2017, DHNS,","Now, pick the right PG course with the help of this website","Aditya Ashok saw his friends go through a gruelling experience while applying for higher education courses. Making the right choice of course and college was a challenge.

Ashok thought it was the need of the hour to have an online platform to offer students counselling on options they could consider after completion of degree courses. Hence came the idea of setting up 30MinGuidance, an online platform which Ashok has set up, along with his friends.

Started a year ago, the online platform www.30minguidance.com offers free counselling to students for 30 minutes where they can interact with a group of students and working professionals who have previously graduated from universities across the world. 

Ashok, an alumnus of Siddaganga Institute of Technology, Tumakuru, said the idea occurred to him when his friend struggled to make the right choice. “Both of us graduated from the same college. It was convenient for me to make a choice as I got guidance from various sources. I saw my own batchmate struggle. I decided to do something about it,” he added.

Speaking to DH, the 28-year-old said though there are several consultancies which provide counselling in real-time, they are not affordable. “We also did a reality check. We understood that any graduate with a full-time job or a person pursuing a PhD or post-doctoral fellowship could guide students equally well,”  he added.

Besides offering counselling on making the right choice for postgraduation, students on the platform also help their juniors rewrite resumes and statements of purpose for various universities. “Some of them come with three- to four-page-long statements. We rewrite it for them,” he said.

The website aims at helping students from rural areas as they do not have enough access to counselling or guidance available to those from metropolitan cities.

Students can avail themselves of counselling from remote locations also. One has to log into their site for appointments, following which an interaction would be facilitated based on the student’s speciality. As students are not asked to pay for the sessions, the 30MinGuidance has on board people who offer voluntary services only."

The Jawaharlal Nehru Planetarium will be reopening on January 17, almost nine months after it was closed for renovation.

With the planetarium adopting upgrade technology, a session in the sky theatre will allow you to pass through the rings of Saturn, glide along nebulae and explore the Milky Way galaxy.

The newly installed hybrid projector systems give viewers an immersive experience, director of the planetarium, Dr B S Shylaja, said. The technology used in the sky theatre has been upgraded for the first time in the last 27 years.

“Earlier, we were using an opto-mechanical projector. We tried to digitise it with add-on devices but the experience did not match up,” Dr Shylaja said. The Rs 12-crore makeover brought in equipment and expertise from Germany. The theatre will now have an opto-mechanical projector to recreate the sky, supported by six digital projectors which will create sharp and realistic images making the experience more immersive. Besides, the circular seating has been replaced by unidirectional seating to ensure better viewing and audio.

“Curiosity about space is increasing and in the years to come, man will land on Mars too. Children will be able to learn about these through planetarium shows which will be sharper and more detailed with the new technology,”  said Prof U R Rao, chairman of the governing council of Bangalore Association for Science Education (BASE), which is in charge of the planetarium.

The planetarium had a collection of 24 shows on various topics, produced in-house since its establishment in 1989. With the old technology, producing a show used to take up to one year.

“We had to manually synchronise the optomechanical lens and the digital equipment like projectors. With computerisation, such constraints are removed and creating a show will take lesser time,” Dr Shylaja said. Since the existing shows are not compatible with the upgraded technology, new shows have to be created. “We will make shows on new themes about extrasolar systems and new space missions to asteroids, comets, mission to Mars and so on. We will ensure that students and visitors get a variety of options for viewing,” Dr Shylaja said. The team is now learning to use the new software.

The renovated sky theatre of the planetarium will be inaugurated on January 17 by Chief Minister Siddaramaiah with a show on the solar system, in Kannada and English. The date for resuming public shows will be announced soon."
"JAN 02 2017, 01:16 IST",City,"Bengaluru, Jan 02, 2017, DHNS,",Bengaluru scientists revive endangered fish species,"A team of scientists at the Central Institute of Freshwater Aquaculture (CIFA) in Bengaluru have revived Hypselobarbus pulchellus, an endangered fish species of peninsular India, using the induced breeding technique.

Induced breeding is a technique whereby fish are stimulated by pituitary hormone to breed in captivity.

This is the first time that scientists here have been successful in induced breeding technique. For the past 50 years, the efforts for induced breeding of this fish were unsuccessful.

The fish, known as ‘Haragi’ or ‘Hullugende’ locally, is endemic to Karnataka waters and once formed an important fishery of the river Tungabhadra. The indiscriminate exploitation of rivers and lack of conservation put many of these fish into the category of threatened, vulnerable and rare species.

Dr N Sridhar, principal scientist and his team at CIFA’s regional research centre, have been studying the reproductive biology and induced breeding of this fish — classified as critically endangered (possibly extinct) by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List — since 2003.

Though initial success was achieved during 2009, it could not be sustained due to visceral fat formation in the abdomen of the fish. By conducting invitro hydrolysis of feed ingredients, Dr Sridhar identified that the traditional feed — containing rice bran and groundnut oil cake — was causing impaired ovary development among the female fish species.

In 2015, a special feed was developed at the centre to overcome the visceral fat formation.

“The new feed ultimately resulted in maturity of the female fish,” said Dr Sridhar, adding, the first generation of the induced bred healthy fingerlings is now being successfully reared at the centre.

“A part of the fish fingerlings will finally be river ranched at Tunga River in Gajanur, Shivamogga in order to enhance this fish stock in the river once they attain a size of about 100 mm,” Dr Sridhar stated.

"JAN 02 2017, 01:19 IST",City,"Rasheed Kappan Bengaluru, Jan 02, 2017, DHNS,","No UGD network, yet Whitefield residents levied sewerage charges","Equipped with private sewage treatment plants (STPs), several housing complexes in Whitefield area under Mahadevapura zone of the BBMP had found ways to reuse the treated water. They had no link to an underground drainage (UGD) network. Yet, the Bengaluru Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB) levies sanitary charges on them. How fair is that?

This is the big question in everyone’s mind, a collective worry articulated by the residents in a letter to the Board in September 2016. The Board is yet to respond, but the rationale behind the cost has stumped many.

The sanitary charges, levied on all residents who use BWSSB’s Cauvery water supply, are to account for the cost incurred by the Board to collect, treat and recycle the used water. The residents contend that this should then apply only to houses and apartments that release the waste water into the BWSSB UGD lines.

The charges, which reflect on the monthly bills, are calculated at the rate of 25% of the overall water bill. A Whitefield Rising (WR) member had this to say: “In many cases, they have been collecting these charges for over five years. It is unfair that without a UGD or any other BWSSB-provided sewage facility, this service has been billed.”

Most STPs set up in the housing complexes are functional, with the treated water reused either within the complexes for gardening or flushing. The excess water is taken away by tankers for construction and farming. Karnataka State Pollution Control Board rules prohibit treated water from being released into storm water drains.

The alternative is to release the water into the UGD lines. But, as a WR representative pointed out, the UGD network has not reached several areas in the zone. “Even if it is ready, the pipes are blocked near Varthur Kodi as the BWSSB STP is not ready. That project will take another two years.”

Sanctioned three years ago, the UGD laying work in Mahadevapura zone had commenced only in mid-2014. Entire stretches of roads were dug up for the pipelines and chambers. The roads were periodically restored, but only after pressure from Whitefield Rising members and other concerned citizens.

Early this year, the government had made it mandatory for all apartments with more than 20 units to set up their own private STPs. The rule being applied retrospectively to even old apartments had triggered widespread opposition from the residents.

Well, the ambulances getting stuck in the traffic jams may soon be a thing of past if the government agencies evince interest in implementing a miniature working model 'Automatic green signal for ambulance', developed by a Class 8 student of a city school.

The model, developed by Ankur Suresh, a student at Shree Ram Public School in the city, would enable the traffic signals turn green automatically on the arrival of ambulance.

Ankur Suresh, a resident of an apartment off Tumakuru Road, said the sight of ambulances getting stuck on the busy stretch was disturbing.

“I have seen ambulances getting stuck for long and the traffic personnel manually operating the signal to give way for the vehicle,” he said.

Explaining the model, Ankur Suresh said, “The model has a sensor, which senses the arrival of the vehicle and turns the signal green, clearing traffic and giving way for the vehicle.”

He hopes that the traffic and the Health department evince interest to adopt the model."

The BBMP has already kept the hard copies of applications ready for those planning to submit them in person. These applications will be made available free of charge at all the 198 ward revenue offices of the Palike. The civic body will begin the process to implement the scheme after receiving the government notification, Mayor G Padmavathi told DH. The notification is likely to be issued in the next two to three days, she added.

BBMP Commissioner N Manjunatha Prasad said that the online system will be in place in about a week's time. “We are working in this regard,” he said.  Once the online system is ready, citizens can log on to the Palike website (www.bbmp.gov.in) and submit the application forms.

Akrama-Sakrama scheme envisages one time regularisation of up to 50% setback and floor area ratio violations (FAR) in case of residential buildings and up to 25% in case of commercial buildings. Besides, illegally formed plots (without approval from planning authorities and without change of land use from revenue authorities) can also be regularised by paying penalty.

Affidavit must
Property owners have to submit an affidavit along with the applications, declaring that the property has been constructed or developed illegally. Senior BBMP officials said that they plan to hold zonal-level meetings soon to ensure that the scheme is implemented successfully and without any glitches.

The mayor said that the Palike expected a revenue of around Rs 400 crore to Rs 500 crore through Akrama-Sakrama scheme. The regularisation fee collected would be utilised for development of parks and major projects to be taken up by the Palike. According to affidavit filed by the BBMP in the high court, there are over 1.54 lakh illegal properties in the city.

National Commission for Women chairperson Lalitha Kumaramangalam came down heavily on the police and slammed home minister G Parameshwara's remarks, demanding that he should resign. The NCW as well as the Karnataka State Commission for Women also sought separate reports from administration and police over the incidents.

Police today said they were looking for the culprits involved in the alleged incidents on Saturday night in and around the junction of Brigade Road and M G Road, where thousands had gathered to herald the New Year.

Eyewitness accounts suggest that women were molested and groped and lewd remarks were also passed by miscreants late night on December 31 in the posh area even as it was claimed that 1,500 police personnel had been deployed to control the crowds.

While women without any male companions had to seek protection from women police personnel, who were very few in number on the spot, men who had come with female friends had a tough time protecting them, according to eyewitnesses.

Speaking to reporters, Home Minister G Parameshwara said ""It is not good. Definitely we will look into it and see that it is not repeated.""

""There was need to look into how such events can be organised and regulated... We cannot have 10,000 police men,"" he said.

Speaking to a TV news channel, he said: ""Unfortunately, what is happening is as I said days like new year Brigade Road, Commercial Street, M G Road, large number of youngsters gather. Youngsters who are almost like westerners, they try to copy the westerners not only in the mindset, but even the dressing.""

The minister's remarks drew an angry response from the NCW chairperson who demanded the Home Minister should resign and apologise to the women of the country for making such remarks.

""Such remarks from the Home Minister are unacceptable and regrettable. I want to ask this Minister that are Indian men so pathetic and weak that when they see a woman in western clothes on a day of revelry, they get out of control?

""When will they Indian men learn to respect women. The Minister should apologise to the women of the country and resign,"" Kumaramangalam said.

Police claimed that thay had made elaborate security arrangements for the New Year eve with 1,500 policemen on duty and several CCTV cameras installed, besides Karnataka State Reserve Police, City Armed Reserve and watch towers erected to keep a close watch.

Police at the spot were apparently outnumbered to control the miscreants.

""We will try to identify the culprits and take action against them,"" Karnataka DGP Om Prakash said.

Police said they had not received any complaints of molestation from anyone.

NCW chairperson Lalitha Kumaramangalam said, ""We are absolutely appalled (with the incident)... We have taken suo motu cognisance on it and have sent off the same to the home minister, the head of the police, chief secretary.""

""We want a reply immediately and if the reply is unsatisfactory, we will send a team to find out why the police has not suo motu taken cognisance of the incident,"" she said.

""I am told that they haven't even looked at the footage they may have from cameras etc and the possibility that they are using the fact that nobody has made an official complaint as an excuse, cannot be ruled out,"" she said.

Meanwhile, Karnataka Commission for Women Chairperson Nagalakshmi Bai told PTI, ""I have taken cognisance of the reported incident. I have sought a report from police. After getting the report, I will take further action.""

Police had extended the deadline allowing restaurants, bars and pubs to remain open till 2 AM on New Year's eve.

They had issued strict warnings to mischief-mongers besides asserting that adequate security arrangements had been made ahead of New Year's eve."

Director: Raajashekar

A remake of 2009 Tamil film Renigunta, Raajashekar’s Mandya to Mumbai is the routine tale of rowdies and murderers who rule the roost. Virtually soaking the screen in gore, the film revolves around Ganesh, who takes to crime following his parents’ murder and is imprisoned for a crime he has not committed.

After his bitter experience in the prison where he gets a taste of the brutal police force, Ganesh solicits the services of hardened criminals — Bharatesh aka Bangi, Jayandra aka Jalli, Kumar aka Kuyya, and Ruman aka Rumi. Ganesh, along with the foursome, escapes from jail, and avenges his parents’ murders by killing Sardar.

Aspiring to grow big as gangsters, they head to the Crime City — Mumbai, and hence the title of the film. The film tries to focus on the reasons that force young men to take to crime. It also has a romantic track were Ganesh falls in love with a mute girl whose uncle wants to push her into the flesh trade.

The film hardly has any entertainment value and makes one wonder what inspired Raajashekar to go for such a trite plot. It is better to watch a Crime File at home."

Kannada (U) Cast: Rakshit Shetty, Rashmika Mandanna, Samyuktha Hegde, Achyut Kumar
Director: Rishab Shetty

Written by Rakshit Shetty and directed by Rishab Shetty, Kirik Party is a cacophonous campus tale spotlighting on the less appreciable aspects of students’ life. The bitter senior-junior rivalry, struggle for hegemony among feuding factions and stalking girls form its kernel. Everything else is anathema in Kirik Party. 

Within this canvas set in Hassan, Rishab Shetty plays to the gallery, weaving two campus romances of antithetical dimensions portrayed in two halves. What is infuriating is that Rishab Shetty Rishab believes bunking classes, copying in exams, throwing tantrums at teachers and principal, whistling and wolfing at campus girls, invading hostels and downing pegs are meatier than the realistic depiction of what constitutes a student’s life.

Needless to say, the teen crowd brings the house down, as Rakshit Shetty and his cronies go about executing Rishab’s familiar take on campus life.

What actually ensures that one does not give up on Kirik Party is the brilliant acting of Rashmika Mandanna and Samyuktha Hegde. If Rashmika — as the stern, studious, bespectacled Saanvi — is a treat to watch with her standoffish mien, Samyuktha Hegde — as the vivacious, carefree Arya — is equally endearing.

In the first half, Rakshit falls for Saanvi while in the second half, a besotted Arya swoons over him. Sadly, despite his own story, Rakshit never rises above his caricature of a student leader Karna, who has a bunch of bullies as loyal friends, whose mission in life is to make life miserable for all around and set the campus literally on fire.

Rakshit has never been impressive after his Ulidavaru Kandante role.  
While the two cupid tales are engaging thanks to Rashmika and Samyuktha, it is the campus life that comes a cropper. What makes Kirik Party also endurable is the soothing score by B Ajaneesh Loknath, each song done soulfully."
"JAN 02 2017, 12:17 IST",Entertainment,"Mumbai, Jan 2, 2016, (PTI),",I am an old school romantic: Shruti Haasan," Actress Shruti Haasan says she strongly believes in the charm of the old-world romance, something which today's internet-savvy generation is missing.

The actress recalls a conversation she had with her father, Kamal Haasan, who pointed out that in his days, love blossomed outside cell phone screens.

""I was talking to my dad and he said half of the love stories happened because we didn't have what's app and we had to actually meet and talk.

""I remember the Nokia phones, the SMSes. There was the landline and the romance was that the guy calls you and you're hoping your mom shouldn't answer. I don't think this generation has that and it is sad,"" Shruti told PTI.

It was the simplicity of romance which instantly attracted the 28-year-old to be a part of the forthcoming film ""Behen Hogi Teri"".

""I love those times we had. My idea of romance is pretty old school. I loved that element in 'Behen Hogi Teri'. The freshness and simplicity is beautiful in this film. I love romantic-comedies. When I am at home and if I want to watch something, I would probably watch a romantic comedy. Surprisingly, I've never been offered rom-coms.""

Directed by Ajay K Pannalal and backed by Amul Mohan, the movie also stars Rajkummar Rao.

Shruti, who has acted in Hindi films like ""D Day"", ""Welcome Back"" and ""Gabbar is Back"", says the film tries to show a side of romance which is important to revisit.

""I really found the narration funny. It rarely happens when you read or hear something which truly cracks you up. I thought the film really takes us back to simpler times, which we all need considering how complicated we have become.""

In the film, she will be seen as the love interest of Rajkummar.

""My character is boisterous. She is a tough cookie but also sensitive. I really liked that. I couldn't relate to everything, but may be that's never been my priority to relate to the character. It's about empathising with the character's emotions and playing it out."""

The 49-year-old star took to social media to share the posters of the films.

""Busy summing up the year gone by? It's time to not look back, but look ahead. Here's what my 2017 looks like. Your thoughts, love and luck needed,"" Akshay wrote.

Akshay is all set for the release of his courtroom comedy-drama ""Jolly LLB 2"". The actor recently wrapped up the shoot of Shree Narayan Singh's ""Toilet Ek Prem Katha"" alongside Bhumi Pednekar.

He will be playing a negative role in the sequel to the 2010 Tamil film ""Enthiran"". The film will mark his first collaboration with Rajinikanth.

While, ""Padman"", directed by R Balki, is reported to be the biopic of Arunachalam Muruganantham, who made headlines for inventing affordable sanitary napkins for women in his village. The film's shooting will begin soon."

The 32-year-old actress is making her Bollywood debut with the movie and SRK took to Twitter to share the posters.

""Tu shama hai toh yaad rakhna... Main bhi hoon parwana..."" Shah Rukh captioned one of the posters.

Mahira plays the 51-year-old actor's love interest in the film, which also stars Nawazuddin Siddiqui as a police officer.

Post Karan Johar's ""Ae Dil Hai Mushkil"", the Rahul Dholakia-directed movie will be the second big film to be released after Raj Thackeray's Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) called for a ban on Pakistani artistes in wake of Uri attacks.

Ahead of the release of ""Raees"" (January 25), Shah Rukh had also met the MNS chief to avoid any pre-release trouble due to Mahira's presence in the movie."

Raees: Shah Rukh Khan, who had a mixed 2016 with ""Fan"" and ""Dear Zindagi"", is returning to action in this Rahul Dholakia-directed drama. Also starring Pakistani actress Mahira Khan and Nawazuddin Siddiqui, the movie will hit the screens on January 25.

SRK is playing a bootlegger who is involved in cat and mouse game with a police officer in the movie and judging by the trailers, it looks like a crowd-pleaser.

Kaabil: Hrithik Roshan is hoping to put the debacle of ""Mohenjo Daro"" and his slug-fest with Kangana Ranaut behind with the Sanjay Gupta-directed thriller ""Kaabil"". Hrithik plays a blind man out for revenge.

The only hitch is that the movie will clash at the box office with ""Raees"". The last box office battle did not go in Hrithik's favour when Akshay Kumar's ""Rustom"" edged out his ""Mohenjo Daro"". Hrithik's producer father had tried to avoid the clash this time by preponing the film's release by a day but not one to be left behind, Shah Rukh too announced January 25 as their release date.

The Ring: SRK's second release of the year is with Imtiaz Ali. Tentatively titled 'The Ring', the romance will see him opposite his ""Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi"" co-star Anushka Sharma.

Rangoon: Kangana Ranaut spent most of 2016 grabbing headlines for her tiff with Roshan but she seems keen to move forward this year with ""Rangoon"", releasing on February 24.

Directed by Vishal Bhardwaj, the period love-triangle, whose poster was released on New Year's day, will see Kangana in the role of an actress.

The movie is equally important for Saif Ali Khan, who faced multiple flops recently. Shahid is also pinning his hope to recreate the ""Kaminey"" and ""Haider"" magic with Bhardwaj. It is Saif and Bhardwaj's second collaboration after ""Omkara"".

Jagga Jasoos: Ranbir Kapoor made a career comeback with ""Ae Dil Hai Mushkil"" after ""Bombay Velvet"" disaster but this year he will face the box office test with ""Jagga Jasoos"".

The actor reunites with his ""Barfi"" director Anurag Basu for the long-in-the-making movie, which also stars his former girlfriend Katrina Kaif. ""Jagga Jasoos"", which also marks Ranbir's production debut, is set to release on April 7.

Tubelight: Eid releases belong to Salman Khan and this year will be no different as the superstar, who has been delivering back-to-back blockbusters be it ""Bajrangi Bhaijaan"" or ""Sultan"", returns with Kabir Khan's ""Tubelight"".

Baahubali: The Conclusion: Fans will finally get the answer for one of the most burning movie questions: ""Why did Katappa kill Baahubali?"" with SS Rajamouli's final chapter releasing this year.

The first part, thanks to its stunning visual effects, resonated well with pan-Indian audience, making the second installment a keenly anticipated release in India on April 28.

Jolly LLB: Akshay Kumar has his slate full with four projects -- ""Jolly LLB 2"", ""Toilet Ek Prem Katha"", ""2.0"" and ""Padman"" but his real test will be the court-room drama where he has taken over from Arshad Warsi.

The first movie did well at the box office so it remains to be seen whether Akshay's presence will bring more eyeballs or it will be a repeat of 'Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai Dobara'.

Baadshaho: Ajay Devgn is reteaming with his ""Once Upon a Time in Mumbai"" director Milan Luthria with ""Baadshaho"". Ajay had a bad 2016 with the debacle of ""Shivaay"".

Rani Padmavati: Sanjay Leela Bhansali's love affair with period stories continues with the director opting to bring the story of Alauddin Khilji's obsession with Rani Padmavati on the big screen. Ranveer Singh plays Khilji, Deepika Padukone is in the role of Rani Padmavati while Shahid Kapoor will play her husband Raja Ratan Singh.

2.0: The movie, a sequel to Rajinikanth's ""Robot"", will see the superstar back in action after ""Kabali"". Directed by Shankar, fans hope Rajini manages to replicate the success of the first part.

Two Bollywood beauties will test the waters of Hollywood with the release of ""Baywatch"" and ""xXx: Return of Xander Cage"". It has become a major point of competition between the fans of Priyanka Chopra and Deepika Padukone.

Other interesting movies to look out for in 2017 are Sidharth Malhotra and Jacqueline Fernandez-starrer ""Reloaded"", ""Fukrey 2"", Varun Dhawan-Fernandez-starrer ""Judwa 2"", Vikramaditya Motwane's ""Trapped"", starring Rajkummar Rao and Shivam Nair's ""Naam Shabana"", which is a spin-off of ""Baby"", starring Taapsee Pannu, ""Poorna"", ""Bareilly Ki Barfi"", ""Meri Pyaari Bindu"", ""Mubarakan"", ""Secret Superstar"", ""Haraamkhor"", ""Begum Jaan"" and ""Newton"" among many others."
"JAN 02 2017, 23:52 IST",Opinion,"Jan 03 , 2017,","Arunachal events, complete disgrace","The formation of a BJP government under Pema Khandu is the culmination of the farcical and manipulative politics being practised in Arunachal Pradesh for more than a year. The BJP has been eyeing the state as part of its project to bring the entire Northeast under its sway. The plan got a boost with the party’s Assembly election victory in Assam and the creation of the North East Democratic Alliance of non-Congress parties. But it is unscrupulous politics, violation of Constitutional norms and use of power and money which has marked the party’s activities in the region. Arunachal Pradesh was the first state in the region to see the worst features of this cynical politics in play, and remains the only one till date to see the toppling game orchestrated at the Centre. The message that it gives to the region and the entire county is negative and dispiriting.

After the Congress government of Nabam Tuki was replaced with the help of dissidents more than a year ago, the state has witnessed only instability and its politics has sunk to newer and newer lows. There have been three chief ministers and a stint of Presidents’s rule, parallel Assembly sessions, disqualifications and counter-actions and impeachments. The murky goings-on also saw the suicide of a former chief minister, Kaliko Pul. Pema Kandu became chief minister after joining the BJP’s ally the People’s Party of Arunachal. Now he has joined the BJP and is officially heading the party’s government in the state. The Supreme Court’s reinstatement of the toppled Congress chief minister and assertion of the best principles of constitutional correctness and propriety in matters relating to the majority of chief ministers and the conduct of state governors eventually did not matter much. The BJP and the central government had a well-laid plan to capture power in the state and pursued it over a period relentlessly, stopping at nothing.

The BJP has now won a victory in the state but the readiness to adopt any tactics to win power and to retain it, to violate the Constitution and the law and even to undermine the orders of the Supreme Court in dubious ways has badly violated the spirit of democracy and vitiated its practice. The BJP is not the only party that has practised this bad politics. It is continuing with a vengeance the wrong policies once followed by the Congress, but the people are the losers. Governments of other states in the region will feel more heat now. The practice of such cynical politics is especially bad for the strategically important and sensitive Northeastern region."
"JAN 02 2017, 23:57 IST",Opinion,"Manoharan N and Shruthi S R Jan 03 , 2017,",Make Lankan fishing pact a success,"Newly appointed Tamil Nadu Chief Minister O Paneerselvam has requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi to “intervene in the sensitive livelihood issue of our fishermen and use diplomatic channels to curb the violent actions of the Sri Lankan Navy on innocent fishermen from Tamil Nadu,” in a letter last month.

Considering the coastlines between the two countries are around 16 km and 45 km at minimum and maximum distances, respectively in the Palk Bay region, the territorial waters of each country in some areas overlap onto the other side. Often, Indian and Sri Lankan fishermen inadvertently stray into each other’s territorial waters due to ignorance of the International Maritime Boundary Line, boat engine failure or sudden turbulence at sea.

When Sri Lankan fishermen are caught poaching in Indian waters off Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Kerala and Orissa, the Indian Coast Guard doesn’t open fire, but arrests and prose-cutes them. The main complaint of Sri Lankan fishermen is against mechanised Indian boats that indulge in “bottom trawling”, an industrial fishing technique that drags large, heavy nets across the seabed, which severely damages marine eco-systems.

Ironically, most of the trawlers are owned by merchant capitalists from non-fishing and other social backgrounds. The entry of these businessmen into the fishing sector has disturbed not only local customary laws of fishing communities, but also turn-ed several traditional fishermen from owners to labourers.

These fishermen work under “fisheries compulsions”: the lesser the catch, the meagre the incentives and fear of losing their jobs. Therefore, Indian fishermen are risk-inclined and transgress into Sri Lankan waters in search of larger catches.

In addition, the mechanised trawler industry is politically influential in Tamil Nadu which makes it more obdurate to solutions that could reduce their profit margins. However, to preserve marine resources and provide enough sustenance to  traditional marginal fishermen of both the countries, it is important to impose a strict ban on employment of mechanised trawlers, which resort to bottom trawling and kills plankton and makes the seabed unfavourable to breed new fishes and prawns. 

After the ‘Eelam War IV’ in May 2009, the Sri Lankan Navy reverted to its primary role to patrol the island’s maritime borders. Still, Sri Lanka and its navy continue to remain vigilant along their maritime borders. In the post-civil war period, the relaxation of fishing restrictions along Sri Lanka’s northern coasts has enabled the Sri Lan-kan fishermen to venture into the sea. The Indian fishermen, who thus far enjoyed monopoly over these marine resource-rich waters, now face stiff competition from their Sri Lankan counterparts. At times, this leads to confrontation mid-seas between these two fishing communities.

Till the ethnic conflict broke out in Sri Lanka in 1983, the movement of fishermen across the Palk Straits was not an issue. Only after the LTTE which emerged as a militant group, with a naval wing or the ‘Sea Tigers’, the situation deteriorated for fishermen on both sides. They were caught in the crossfire between the Sri Lankan Navy and the ‘Sea Tigers’.

During the civil war, the Sri Lankan Navy was focussed on the movement of LTTE boats. Straying Indian fishermen who transgressed into Sri Lankan waters were overlooked, except to monitor goods smuggled in and out of northern Sri Lanka that would support the LTTE’s war fighting capabilities.

Right to life
Both governments should respect the right to life of fishermen and adopt a comprehensive and humane approach to evolve pragmatic solutions without further delay. Given the Indian Tamil fishermen’s dependency on coastal fishing, to immediately phase out mechanised trawlers may be difficult. As an alternative, these large trawlers could be encouraged to venture into high seas across the country’s Exclusive Economic Zones.

To avoid shooting incidents due to “mistaken identity”, both countries could consider ‘coordinated patrolling’ between their marine forces. Additionally, development of ‘fish farms’ extensively in Indian waters would prevent its fishermen to venture into alien waters to search for a ‘big catch’. The solution ultimately lies in better fisheries management. India can also consider leasing fishing blocks, especially those identified as ‘surplus total available catch’, from Sri Lanka which would enable Lanka earn much required foreign exchange.

The Indian Navy has mooted a proposal to fit Global Positioning System (GPS) in every boat to enable fishermen to navigate accurately and determine their locations correctly. Costs of installation could be shared by the Centre and government of Tamil Nadu, with a token contribution from the beneficiary fishermen. Apart from training fishermen to use GPS, the local administration should sensitise them about the need to preserve marine biology and not to transgress into international waters.

There is already such an agreement between fishermen of these two neighbours which they do not adhere to. Besides, New Delhi and Colombo should organise frequent meetings between their fishing communities to explore pragmatic solutions and develop cordial mid-sea relationships with each other.

The school will offer free education for students from standard sixth to 10th.

He was speaking at an interaction programme on Sunday, after spending a night at the residence of one of the Koraga community members at Mururu.

Anjaneya said, “All Morarji Desai schools have 10 % seats reserved for children belonging to Koraga community. The government is ready to hike this to 50 % if the community members place a demand. This would help provide good education for Koraga children.”

A few community members said that the students studying in 10th standard were imparted training. However, the money spent towards the training had not been reimbursed so far. The Integrated Tribal Development Project (ITDP) officer said that the union government had not released funds under the Traditional Dwellers Development Programme for the last three years.

The minister directed the officials to send details of the money spent towards training and assured them that the state government would release the funds. The leaders of the community also urged the government to continue integrated development programme for tribals and to earmark separate fund for the development of members belonging to Koraga community.

Visit to Krishna Mutt
Later, the minister had lunch at Sri Krishna Mutt along with other devotees under ‘Sahapankti Bhojana.’

After paying his obeisance to Lord Krishna on the first day of the new year, he also spoke to Pejawar Paryaya seer Sri Viswesha Theertha Swamiji and sought his blessings. The seer served sweets to the minister and lauded his efforts in reaching out to the last man in society.

Speaking with mediapersons, the minister said he did not find any senselessness as alleged by a few fractions of society in practicing pankthi bedha in Sri Krishna Mutt.

The Pejawar seer treats everyone equally and has no discriminatory views, he said and added that he wished to take ‘prasadam’ of Lord Krishna with devotees belonging to all caste and creed. Dharma is nothing but upholding equality and humanity, he said.

He was accompanied by District In-charge Minister Pramodh Madhwaraj and Rajya Sabha member Oscar Fernandes.

At the inaugural programme of district-level swimming competitions organised as part of Karavali Utsava at Mangala Swimming Pool in Mangaluru on Sunday, Ivan said he has apprised the legislative assembly about the need for a swimming pool in the city.

He said a resolution would be moved towards construction of another swimming pool by the MCC in Mangaluru as there are plenty of children who are taking a liking for the sport. MCC swimming pool has been functioning for the past 35 years and has been offering an opportunity for learners at nominal prices.

He said a state-of-the-art swimming pool would come up in Emmekere at a cost of Rs 12 crore. He was optimistic about India winning international medals in swimming even in the Olympics.

International swimmer Vaishnav Hegde inaugurated the swimming competition and called upon parents to encourage their wards in whichever sport they are willing to take up. He said students too must get into sports only if they are really interested in it and not because their parents suggest that they take up sports.

Department of Youth Empowerment and Sports Deputy Director Pradeep D’Souza said that eight categories of sporting events including swimming, kabaddi, basket ball, wrestling and judo would be conducted as part of ‘Khelo India’ and those who win the district-level events would be selected for the state-level.

Corporator Jayanti Achar presided over the programme. Department of Youth Empowerment and Sports Assistant Director Lily Pais, Mangala Swimming Club president Pramukh Rai and Swimming Pool manager Ramesh were present at the function.

Around 300 participants took part in various categories including open, freestyle, back, breast and butterfly meant for boys and girls of different age groups.

“This indicates the failure of the administration and the legislator is directly responsible for this. If the accused in the murder case are not arrested within 10 days, there are possibilities that Dakshina Kannada district will be in flames,” said the MP. He was addressing the protest meet and jatha conducted by Hindu Rakshana Vedike outside the Konaje police station on Sunday.

Stating that the failure of the police in detaining the accused is clearly seen, Kateel accused the police personnel of acting as agents of the Congress party. “The police should protect the people rather being followers of politicians.”

BJP Mangaluru Assembly unit president Santosh Kumar Boliyar said that the constituency witnesses a greater number of untoward incidents as compared to other constituencies in the district. He warned that a dharna would be staged right outside the police station if the accused in the Kartik Raj murder case are not arrested within 10 days.

Hindu Jagarana Vedike Vittal taluk unit convener Ganaraj Bhat Kedila said that if one considers the horrific incidents taking place in Ullal, one would wonder if one is witnessing a part of India or Pakistan. Even though the police honestly probe into the case, the government is unnecessarily interfering, he added.

"JAN 02 2017, 17:25 IST",Archives,"Washington, Jan 2, 2017, PTI,",Father's obesity may affect child's social skills,"Children of obese fathers are more likely to have difficulty interacting with others, according to a new study which shows that weight of parents may cause developmental delays in kids, affecting their motor skills and problem solving abilities.

Children of obese fathers were more likely to fail measures of social competence and those born to extremely obese couples also were more likely to fail tests of problem solving ability, researchers have found.

Researchers from the US National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), found that children of obese mothers were more likely to fail tests of fine motor skill - the ability to control movement of small muscles, such as those in the fingers and hands.

""The previous US studies in this area have focused on the mothers' pre- and post-pregnancy weight,"" said Edwina Yeung from NICHD.

""Our study is one of the few that also includes information about fathers, and our results suggest that dad's weight also has significant influence on child development,"" said Yeung.

Researchers reviewed data collected from more than 5,000 women enrolled in the study roughly four months after giving birth in New York State between 2008 and 2010.

To assess development, parents completed a questionnaire after performing a series of activities with their children.

The test is not used to diagnose specific disabilities, but serves as a screen for potential problems, so that children can be referred for further testing.

Children in the study were tested at four months of age and retested six more times through age three.

When they enrolled, mothers also provided information on their health and weight - before and after pregnancy - and the weight of their partners.

Compared to children of normal weight mothers, children of obese mothers were nearly 70 per cent more likely to have failed the test indicator on fine motor skill by age three.

Children of obese fathers were 75 per cent more likely to fail the test's personal-social domain - an indicator of how well they were able to relate to and interact with others by age three.

Children with two obese parents were nearly three times more likely to fail the test's problem solving section by age three.

It is not known why parental obesity might increase children's risk for developmental delay.

Researchers note that animal studies indicate that obesity during pregnancy may promote inflammation, which could affect the fetal brain.

The study appears in the journal Pediatrics."
"JAN 02 2017, 23:55 IST",Opinion,"Uttam Gupta Jan 03 , 2017,",Rajan's legacy continues,"In the first monetary policy review under the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) dispensation announced on October 4, 2016, Reserve Bank of India Governor Urjit Patel had reduced the policy rate (interest rate at which RBI lends money to commercial banks) by 0.25%. He had then maintained an ‘accommodative’ policy stance thereby alluding to apex bank intent for reducing it further.

However, in the second policy review announced on December 7, Patel has dashed this hope by keeping the repo rate unchanged. Concurrently, he has also revised downwards its earlier estimate of GDP for 2016-17 from 7.6% to 7.1% now factoring in the effect of demonetisation of Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 notes announced by the prime minister on November 8.

Read together, the two statements are anomalous. At a time when putting India on to a high growth trajectory is a dire necessity (to create jobs and increase income), the apex bank’s own assessment of significant decline in GDP growth should have led it to consider reduction in interest rate. Yet, it has decided to keep it unchanged. The irony is that very much like his predecessor (Raghuram Rajan), Patel too sees interest rate as a potent instrument of reining in inflation. This is not unexpected as in his earlier incarnation as deputy governor under Rajan — he became popular as ‘inflation warrior’ being part and parcel of latter’s hawkish approach.

Team Rajan/Patel was overly conservative in its approach. It did not reduce policy rate despite consumer price index (CPI) showing signs of easing during second half of 2014. From January 2015, till April 2016, it conceded a cut of only 1.5% (from 8% to 6.5%) despite a drastic drop in CPI. In the policy reviews in June 2016, and August 2016, the rate was kept unchanged.

In December 2016 policy review also, Patel has not reduced the rate despite CPI decreasing to 4.2% during October 2016 (led mainly by food which fell by 3.32%) and further down to 3.63% in November 2016. Pertinently, the current inflation is also within the 5% target set for quarter ending March 2017 and medium-term target of 4% for the five-year period ending 2021.

In support of the decision, Patel has cited global uncertainties, financial turbulence, likely increase in Federal (Fed in short) rate by USA, expectation of increase in the price of food etc. The first two factors have existed all through; had these been so compelling, the RBI ought not to have cut the rate even during January 2015 till April 2016.

As regards food price, in monetary policy statement accompanying the October 4, 2016 review, the RBI observed that “strong improvement in sowing along with supply management measures will improve the food inflation outlook.” It expected “a moderating influence on food inflation in the months ahead.”

Since then, the only development is demonetisation (November 8). Contrary to much hype about its likely impact on agriculture, sowing during current rabi, 2016-17 has not been affected (Dr Ramesh Chand, member Niti Aayog expects growth to be 5% during current year) Therefore, food price scenario won’t change.

With regard to the Fed rate, true, the FRB (Federal Reserve Board) of USA has increased it by 0.25% (second time in a decade). This, together with strengthening dollar against rupee, may increase the risk of capital outflow. But, to infer on this basis alone that funds will move out of India is far-fetched.

The real driver of foreign funds inflow is confidence in Indian economy, ease of doing business and pace of reforms. In all these areas, the rating agencies have given full marks to the government. This will ensure that even after Fed rate hike, foreign investors will stay invested in India.

Clearly, none of the factors mentioned by the RBI were so compelling as to disallow a rate reduction. It is simply the ‘fear’ of inflation that haunts men at the helm in the apex bank. They do not even bother to introspect that the connection between interest rate and inflation especially from demand side is very weak.

They merely proceed on the premise that any reduction in interest rate would exacerbate inflation by boosting aggregate demand. This is flawed. Nearly 50% of CPI includes food items. It would be fallacious to argue that easy and cheap credit will prompt people to increase their demand or stock them.

Food inflation
The inflation in food is mainly a function of supply. If there is disruption in supply, then price will rise even if interest rate is high. On the other hand, if supply is managed well then, inflation can be tamed even with low interest rate. Clearly, interest rate is not a deterrent and it has no role in inflation management. The MPC should come out of this flawed inflation-interest nexus.

Instead, the committee should seriously think through as to how monetary policy can be galvanised to spur growth. Keeping interest rate low is very crucial to give a boost to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) including startups. Hitherto, a majority of the SMEs were cash driven and have been battered by demonetisation. In this backdrop, lower rate on loans will be a great help.

Lower rate is also needed to improve viability of infrastructure projects like roads, rails, power, port etc, and enable them provide utilities and services at competitive tariffs. It will also help reduce interest subsidy that banks give to keep cost of credit to farmers low. It will enh-ance the competitiveness of our exports.

At present, banks are flush with funds (already, in the follow up to scrapping of notes, they have got deposits worth Rs 13,00,000 crore) and a lot of these would remain in low cost savings and current accounts . This will enable them to reduce cost of funds. But the RBI should not use this as an alibi for avoiding cut in policy rate. Hope, in the next round, it makes the right move.

"JAN 02 2017, 22:40 IST",Metrolife,"Anushree Agarwal Jan 03 , 2017, DHNS,",Making a big difference,"In today’s day and age, there are large scale multi-billion dollar e-commerce vendors, causing an industry imbalance against small traders and service providers. The latter generally don’t come with a big advertisement budget to fight this competition. And it’s not just a loss of their market share but also often potential neighbourhood customers are swayed away to the larger players.

Even with customers, it happens quite often that when they are travelling, they are driven to what is available in the nearby vicinity than what they actually want. This is exactly what led Ravindhar Achchi Rangarajan to start ‘Fly2Spot’, a hyperlocal marketplace where small traders and service providers can build their own marketplace and reach their customers. The startup began with a pilot, expanded to Chennai and is presently available in Bengaluru.

“‘Fly2Spot’ is a marketplace app that lets users locate, explore and find the products of their need available in their neighbourhood, even when they are on the move. The users can experience the virtual tour of the stores, browse through all the available products and get to know the various offers,” says Ravindhar.

“While at home or even on the move, you can still find your choice of products, services and best deals with a single tap on your mobile phone. You might be searching for a product in the whole city, which may be available in your nearby store. You can explore all these products in the entire city just by exploring ‘Fly2Spot’,” he adds.

And how do sellers benefit from it? Explains Ravindhar, “The traditional shop owner with a restricted target audience in a particular area does not have a simple platform to showcase his products or deals without much investment. ‘Fly2Spot’ is a special business platform for these sellers. They can easily create their stores, add products, display deals and target their nearby audience at a very low cost. They can also customise their shop anytime.”

The users in ‘Fly2Spot’, he informs, are mostly serious buyers who look for a particular product on the move. They can easily reach out to the customers in an area using customised ads. “We guide them to go for a short and crisp title and an image with a description, that will grab everyone’s attention in their locality,” he says.

The app is presently available for Android users on the Google Playstore. Ravindran has also created ‘SafeOut’, a women safety and security product, designed to prevent violence and crime against women, which will be launched shortly. ‘SafeOut’ will connect the demand for help, real time, during distress and emergency situations to their kith and kin, nearby social networking volunteers and law enforcement agencies with just a single tap. It will also provide a platform for the collaboration among the kith and kin as well as volunteers and law enforcement agencies for an effective rescue mission."

The team will still compete as new owners were found but it was something of a dampener for the much-awaited event which was further clouded over by allegations of rule bending to accommodate some teams. Nevertheless, something is better than nothing and aficionados welcome the event in the hope that it will bolster the interest in badminton, which is riding on a wave of popularity after the recent successes of Saina Nehwal and P V Sindhu.

Says Rohit Venugopal, professional and badminton enthusiast, “Badminton is enjoying immense popularity in the country thanks to some great athletes performing at the highest levels. This event is going to build on that success and hopefully truly launch the sport in Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities across the country. It is also a wonderful platform for Indian players to rub shoulders and be teammates with the cream of the sport. Overall the league will surely help the sport to grow in the country but more importantly it will help bring the game into public consciousness which is otherwise overwhelmed with cricket. Thankfully there is no series in the first half of January for cricket so that should be a good boost as well.”

“It is a great initiative from the Badminton Association of India,” says Avinash Kumbhar, another badminton buff. “The appeal of the game has increased and tournaments like these will push players to perform as well as give them a platform to showcase their talent.” Charchita Pramanik, founder of ‘Crazy Shuttlers’, an e-club for badminton enthusiasts, feels that while the game has been getting it’s rightful share of attention in recent time, such meets will definitely help in promoting the sport and increasing the attraction for games other than cricket.

“Most of us at the club are planning to go for it. It will be a great chance to see international players as well as our very own heroes.” Asked about who she wants to see in action, Charchita’s reply is prompt. “P V Sindhu, of course. She is the star of badminton right now.” What about Olympic gold medallist Carolina Marin, who overcame Sindhu in the inaugural match in Hyderabad.

“Yes, it would be wonderful to see her too. She has technique, flair and everything else going for her. As a player, I admire her but as an Indian, I adore Sindhu and really hopes she wins,” Charchita says with a smile. “New concepts are coming up in this game and a lot of parents are showing an interest in sending their children to learn badminton now,” adds Avinash. “This happens when a particular sport starts coming up.”

But is there a concern that the glitz, glamour and money involved will take the focus away from the sport — an echo of doubts that were raised when the IPL was introduced? “It is true that the focus was more on entertainment in IPL but cricket was already at a different level at that time,” explains Avinash.

 “But that is not the case with badminton. People are hardly excited about going for a badminton match and thus we need all the attention we can get. There is a need to push the game more. Also, cricket is a team sport. Badminton is about reflexes. You can win only if you are the best and nothing can change this,” he asserts."
"JAN 02 2017, 23:10 IST",Metrolife,"Surupasree Sarmmah Jan 03 , 2017, DHNS,",Dramatic silhouettes,"With a belief that designing should be an answer for people seeking the perfect fit, designer Smriti Jhunjhunwala took her first step into the fashion industry four-and-half-years ago. And since then, she has always succeeded in adding a surprise element to each of her collections, the latest being the fluttering cape sleeves. In a chat with Surupasree Sarmmah, the young designer gets candid about her love for food and fashion, her fashion philosophy, her latest collection and much more.

It has been four-and-a-half-years in the industry...
I always wanted to be in the fashion industry. I remember the times when my mother used to take me to the tailor and I used to dedicatedly involve myself with the creation of various patterns and designs I would like to have in my outfit. That’s when the interest grew in me and it became stronger as I grew up. For me designing is all about the perfect fit and I wanted to give people just that.

Have you ever thought of an alternate profession?
If not a designer, I would have definitely been doing something in the food industry. I would have perhaps opened a cafe or a restaurant. Food and fashion have always been my main attractions.

Your latest collection looks edgy and contemporary...
Capes are something that always fascinated to me. Cape sleeves are very chic, classy and timeless; the extra burden of carrying a dupatta with an attire is dropped to a great extent and makes the outfit more easy to wear. I have included more embroidery on the capes and kept the gowns and bottoms subtle. The highlighted colours are navy blue, beige, maroon, greys, pink, gold and peach. Georgette, butterfly net and crepe are some of the primary fabrics I have used in this collection.

Your favourite fabric to work with?
It has to be georgette. The fact that it is an extremely feminine and chic fabric makes it my most favoured material to work with.

If you are a new addition to the closet, which outfit would you like to be and why?
I would want to be a gown. Gowns are a great way to flaunt one’s feminine side and it can be both Indian and Western. It is a chic representation of a woman.

Three things you would like to have with you, if you are stranded in an island...
A bag full of food, the book I will be reading at that point of time and a few magazines.

What is your fashion philosophy?
Pick what you like. Fit and fall are the major aspects of an outfit, as it defines your personality.

Do you like to keep up with trends...
I don’t really keep up with trends, especially when it comes to colours. I like to use whatever feels and looks the best. However, I look up for trends for reference and to keep myself updated.

Anyone you would like to dress up?
Alia Bhatt and Deepika Padukone.

Your views on sustainable fashion...
People have become more open to sustainable fashion these days. It is becoming popular in India and is definitely here to stay."
"JAN 02 2017, 23:12 IST",Metrolife,"Surupasree Sarmmah Jan 03 , 2017, DHNS,",Can't hold them down,"It was not long ago when movie theatres across the city echoed with hoots and howls when Sonakshi Sinha threw a strong punch at her male counterpart in the movie ‘Akira’. The movie, focussed on a woman’s unbreakable strength and will power, received appreciation from the audience across all age groups.

‘Akira’ is just one among the many movies that Bollywood has seen in the recent past, breaking the stereotype of a conventional female character in Hindi cinema; a character that is mostly portrayed as an object of entertainment and suitable only to dance to provocative songs. With the recent releases like ‘Dangal’, ‘Pink’, and ‘Kahaani 2’, it is being seen that filmmakers today are concentrating more on concepts like ‘gender no bar’ and ‘equality to women’. From the toughest action sequences (without body-doubles) to speaking up for themselves and questioning age-old notions of patriarchy, these movies send out a strong message from the reel to the real world.

Many youngsters in the city are of the opinion that women-centric movies like Neerja (that showcased the exemplary courage of a woman, first to speak up about an abusive relationship and then to stand up against evil) and ‘Dangal’ (which highlights the fact that women are on par with men in terms of physical strength too) can change the mindset of people in the long run.

Vijay Krishnan, an aspiring cinematographer, says, “Most of the movies still are male-centric and women have no big role to play in them, but with recent movies like ‘Pink’, a sense of power was attached to the female characters. We saw female actors taking the lead in this film, while Amitabh Bachchan was seen playing the role of a supporting actor. I see these movies as influential, both for the society and for other filmmakers.”

He adds that since women-centric movies have not been explored much, there is great scope to come up with engaging and inspiring scripts. “I, as a male audience, really appreciate movies where the character of the female actor is fiercely strong and is on par with her male counterpart,” he says. 

Abhilash K L, a professional at Phase One events, however, is of the opinion that filmmakers should keep in mind not to make a movie extremely feminist which can take away the real essence of the script. “For a long time, objectifying a woman was the main selling point of a movie, but this thought is slowly changing. I believe that there should be more women-centric movies as the audience is changing and so is their perception. It adds more value to a movie,” says Abhilash.

Many directors see a risk in making a women-centric movie as they think it won’t be commercially viable, highlights Shruthi Raghunanda, an actor. “When two non-actors in the movie ‘Dangal’ could create a stir in the society, it is clear that people are accepting movies where the protagonist is a woman. No one cares about a movie like ‘Befikre’ or movies which talk about a zero size actress and where men fall for her makeup and looks. The audience today has become more sensible and expects to watch a movie that brings about a change in the mindset of people and society at large,” says Shruthi."
"JAN 02 2017, 23:15 IST",Metrolife,"Tini Sara Anien Jan 03 , 2017, DHNS,",Convenience at your doorstep,"How many times have you looked at a dirty pile of clothes and wondered if someone would clean them for you, just the way you want them? On these lines is the on-demand laundry service, ‘The Laundry Basket’, that was founded by Bengaluru boys Ankit Kala and Nakul Patni. 

The twosome have been friends since childhood and they wanted to start their own venture, which saw the birth of the startup. Nakul, who studied abroad — Singapore and Australia — saw the need for a usable laundry service option in the city. “It was when I studied outside that the idea came into my head. There are a lot of similar services in the city, but we keep it different through our format and work model,” he says.

Ankit says that though the duo aimed at starting an efficient laundry system for apartments, the pilot-run for the idea moved on to become the startup itself. There is a huge demand for such services in cities like Bengaluru, Pune and Hyderabad, which has a huge bachelor and expatriate crowd, says Nakul. “There are a lot of students at these places. We have tried to keep our services usable according to one’s daily requirements and make it a habit for the customer, thus our services are billed according to a load and not on kilogram basis,” he adds. The service allows customers to drop-off their laundry at any of the hubs or schedule a pick-up via call or online facilities. “For those who do not like others handling their garments, we also provide DIY (Do-It-Yourself) options wherein the customers are free to use our machine themselves,” says Ankit.

The service currently has five outlets in the city — Indiranagar, Koramangala, HSR Layout, Bannerghatta Road and Kumaraswamy Layout. “There are many who are apprehensive about the detergents used, how the clothes are washed and the hygiene factor. Since we charge according to a load, one’s clothes are washed only with their own and not mixed with other people’s clothes,” he adds. Nakul adds that most customers want their washed clothes back as soon as possible and this isn’t a feasible option with the local ‘dhobhiwalla’. “Thus we have kept the timeline for delivery of clothes within 24 hours, which has fetched us great response,”  he says.

The website, which is  www.thelaundrybasket.in, provides details of the services. “We go by a basic module of 4.5 kg per load which is charged Rs 219. Every additional kg is charged Rs 25. The garments which have to ironed are charged separately,” says Nakul. For Nakul, who holds a Masters degree in marketing and Ankit, who holds a commerce degree and has worked three years with the family business, managing and understanding the technological part of the service was a bit of an issue.

“Also figuring out the logistics of the two-way trips, especially the challenges of scheduling pick-ups and drops, can be tricky,” says Nakul. He adds that quality of the services provided can also be challenging, according to the garments that come in. “Meeting to the expectations of the customer is also a challenge,” says Nakul. Ankit adds that with the startup gearing up for its second anniversary, they will be relaunching their mobile application and the website. “The competition is far more now and the standards to meet are much higher,” Ankit sums up with a smile."
"JAN 02 2017, 23:18 IST",Metrolife,"Tini Sara Anien Jan 03 , 2017, DHNS,",Emotions at play,"It was eight years back, that singer-songwriter Mahesh Raghunandan got into music. The young musician, who started out solo, formed a band later on, but is now back into making music himself. In a candid chat with Tini Sara Anien, the artiste talks about his journey so far.

How did music happen?
I grew up listening to music. The change happened when I heard ‘Gravity’ by John Mayer, which is when I wanted to take music to a more serious level. I was listening to the lyrics and I felt that it was all different, which helped bring a feeling in me that I had never had before. I wanted to express myself which is when I started writing too.

Your genre of music is ...
My music combines Indie folk, folk rock, pop rock and soul along with a hint of blues.

What inspires you to perform/write music?
I keep telling this to myself — if I want to write a song about punching someone in the face, when I sing or perform it, it will have to emote as much as possible for the listener to feel that he or she is being punched in the face. That is the whole idea — to translate the emotion as accurately and as clearly as possible through words and melody. When I am starting a song, I keep playing the melody and ask myself what it makes me feel inside. Emotions play the biggest role in my songs.

Some of your own compositions include...
I have worked on 24 songs. ‘Sleep’, ‘Your Kind of Love’, ‘Your Story’, ‘Your Mind’, ‘Finders Keepers’ and ‘Kill Me’ are some of the songs I’ve worked on.

One of your most important works...
A song called ‘Sleep’, which reignited the whole process of writing by itself, is an important song. The song was inspired by the photograph of a baby that was just born. It helped me to create this song which was a lullaby-cum-romantic one, which I performed at a small birthday party. A friend took a video of me performing the song and posted it online. That spread like wildfire. The post fetched around 60,000 views and opened up the doors to many opportunities, including people like Vishal Dadlani noticing me.

Who are your biggest influences?
Of course John Mayer, as that’s where I started off from. I’m influenced by a range of artistes like Ray Charles, Stevie Wonder, Frank Sinatra, Damien Rice and BB King, among others. I’m also drawn to many singer-songwriters from Ireland.  Each one of them has their own way of expressing themselves or an idea or a story. Every single time I hear their works, I ask myself what are they trying to do? Every single word they say and how they are trying to express these matters.

Interesting performances that you want to highlight...
I have opened for artistes like ‘The Raghu Dixit Project’, Bruce Lee Mani of ‘Thermal and a Quarter’, Parvaaz, ‘The Kutle Khan Project’, Sanjeev Thomas, Baiju Dharmajan and international artistes like Lucy Rose, Luke Sital-Singh from the UK and Ty Penshorn from Australia. I performed a singer-songwriter set at The Bacardi NH7 Weekender in the city in 2015.

What’s next?
I will be touring to Gujarat, Kochi, Kerala, Mumbai and Delhi soon. I’m also working on an EP  which is inspired from ‘Let Me Stay’, which is about staying in the moment."
"JAN 02 2017, 23:20 IST",Metrolife,"Rajitha Menon Jan 03 , 2017, DHNS,",The sweet smell of success,"It is said that perfume is the most intense form of memory. Rightfully so. Many people associate persons, events and even places with smell. Think of the aroma of fresh coffee, the heady scent of the first drops of rain falling on the ground or the sweet smell of an old book and a hint of a smile will linger on your face. And since the sense of smell is one of the strongest senses we have, how we look at a person is also strongly influenced by our olfactory system.

“When you are meeting someone for the first time or going out in public, smelling nice is very important,” says Binesh Balakrishnan, a professional at Accenture. “I believe that the first impression is also the last impression and smelling good is synonymous with being groomed and looking good.” After all, who doesn’t love perfume? It can complete an outfit, uplift your mood and give you confidence to get through any day. And the Indian populace is increasingly becoming aware of the significance of leave a fragrant impact on others.

“Till almost 10 years ago, there were limited options in this industry,” says Mohit Khatri, perfumologist and founder of ‘Project Perfume India’. “We knew about a few foreign brands that were heavily marketed. But now, there is a distinct shift with people moving from designer ones towards niche and indie perfumes . By indie perfumes, I mean handmade perfumes from independent artistes without the backing of big brand names. And the number of perfume users in general has gone up by almost 10 times.”

Talking about some of the trends in this sector, Mohit continues, “Animal scents have been popular for quite some time and continue to remain so. The reason for this is that, for us as humans, animal scents evoke the senses. So there is a preference for scents like musk and civet. While musk was widely used in ancient times, what we have these days is the synthetic version of this. In earthy scents, vetiver, which smells somewhat like damp soil, is the most popular one now. But the very latest fascination is with leather perfumes. It makes you smell like you just stepped out of a very expensive Aston Martin.”

The fad for unique and distinct aromas is certainly catching up and is leading to a lot of interesting experimentation in the field. Says Manan Gandhi, founder, Bombay Perfumery, “My family has been in the perfumery business for 35 years now, supplying raw material to perfumery houses across the country. I set up my own perfumery label here with an aim to put a modern spotlight on Indian natural ingredients and give the consumers a genuine homegrown brand. Indian naturals are used so often in perfumes across the world but they are never given their due here.”

His purpose is to inspire nostalgia for a selection of quintessentially Indian experiences like fresh masala chai, spice bazaars, iconic cities and so on. “We have some unique varieties like Sulawesi, Chai Musk and Moire. Sulawesi has many facets — woody, amber, tobacco, green — but is balanced by an addition of spices like nutmeg and the sweetness of custard apple. Chai Musk is an addictive woody fragrance inspired by a cup of good, strong chai infused with lemongrass. Moire is Bombay Perfumery’s ode to the art of perfumery, with its studied ingredients ranging from tuberose to leather,” he adds.

The preference is shifting to darker scents these days, away from the fresh, citrus variants that have ruled the roost for many years, adds Mohit. “Personalised fragrances are becoming popular too; where customers get customised fragrances depending on their personality and work environment. Everyone, from working professionals to college students, are recognising the importance of grooming and perfumes are an integral part of it. And people are willing to pay for this too,” he says. So do people judge others by their perfume? “I don’t know about that but I judge people by their lack of perfume,” laughs Binesh."
"JAN 02 2017, 23:30 IST",Metrolife,"Nina C George Jan 03 , 2017, DHNS,",A tale of generations,"It’s hard to take your eyes off Tosher G Hormusjee’s 1927 Fiat. And it’s not just the colour that grabs one’s attention, even the design and shape are typical of cars of the 1920s. One can’t resist the temptation of wanting to know more about the vehicle and get an insight into how Tosher restored the grand old lady.  Tosher has grown up around vintage and classic vehicles. His father was a connoisseur of these old beauties and that passion has been passed on to Tosher.

Every car in Tosher’s stable has a story behind it and is indeed special because he has taken a lot of trouble in not only restoring each one of them but has also personally handpicked every vehicle. “I don’t want to reel out how many cars I have but among the existing ones, my father’s Mercedes is close to my heart. It is presently under restoration,” says Tosher. Tosher has armed himself with an inexhaustible amount of knowledge and information about these vehicles. “There was a time when I would work on the cars myself because I never wanted to hand them over to a mechanic, especially after our 1951 Morris was stolen. Now it’s hard for me to spend as much time as I used to. I have managed to make space for these cars to be parked at one place and I hope to find a full-time help to work on them. My son too helps me with the restoration,” says Tosher.

The excitement in his voice is palpable when he gets talking about his lineup. “I remember we brought the 1927 Fiat home in different boxes. It was given to me by my aunt Jini Kharas and her daughters Meher and Pheroza. I was so eager to see it back on the road that I lost no time and began working on restoring it almost immediately. Finally, when the car was ready, we had to literally break the walls of the house to move the car out because the gate was meant for smaller vehicles,” he recalls. He informs that the car has been with the family for over 50 years. The Fiat is fondly nicknamed as ‘boozy’. “We call her ‘boozy’ because she consumes a lot of oil. The shape of the car is similar to cars of the 1920s. It is a 1600 cc, four cylinder engine with a side valve,” shares Tosher.
 
The first Morris to be brought into the Tosher household was a white 1951 Morris Minor which Tosher gifted to his wife Radhika. “The car was stolen and we bought another 1951 green colour Morris as the replacement car. It was a well-maintained vehicle and continues to be in a good condition,” he adds. Radhika belongs to the royal family of Travancore. She too has grown up amidst a fleet of vintage vehicles. Her grandfather H R H Kerala Varma is now 101 years old but his love for these old cars is still very strong. Tosher’s son Zoish and daughter Roshni too share his love for cars.

He also has an interesting line up of vintage bikes. “The oldest among the bikes is a 1907 Norton, followed by the 1956 BSA 650 Golden Flash twin which belonged to my father and there’s also a 1940 Matchless,” he adds. Tosher’s parents were so fond of travelling in their old vehicles that the duo did a tour of sorts on their Lambretta. “In 1960, my parents travelled the southern part of the country on the Lambretta. They also took their dachshunds with them,” informs Tosher. Tosher isn’t a regular to any of the vintage car rallies in the city. He quietly derives joy in simply restoring these old beauties."
"JAN 02 2017, 23:34 IST",Metrolife,"Nina C George Jan 03 , 2017, DHNS,",For some extreme action,"The sight of a rider doing a wheelie and then spinning on one wheel is sure to leave you wondering whether the person at the wheel has ever experienced fear. It takes a lot of guts to perform stunts and more than anything, the person at the wheel has to be a trained professional. The many bike stunts that one gets to see on the streets are illegal and invite stern action from the higher authorities. But here is a group of professionals who also happen to be professional stunt riders.

They’ve not only performed on different platforms across the city but have also taken it upon themselves to educate people about the safety measures involved while performing stunts. This group of stunt riders, comprising Rizwan, Jupsy, Kalander, Dempsy, Mahesh and a few others, says that this hobby gives them the much-needed break from their usual work routine. While their regular jobs keep them occupied through the week, they get together on weekends to practice their stunt moves.

Jupsy, who leads the team, says that he got into stunt riding because he was curious about how professional riders perform these daring acts to perfection. “The first thing that I understood after watching some of the foreign videos on stunt riding is that one has to be a thorough professional to be able to perform these daring acts. I got trained before I ventured into performing. I also make sure that every member of the team first understands the intent and philosophy of the group before wanting to be a part of it,” he explains.

Kalandar Naushad, another member of the team, couldn’t agree more with Jupsy about the uncompromising attitude of the team towards wearing safety gear. “The first thing that struck me about the group is their positive approach towards stunt riding. I noticed that they would never venture out without wearing the necessary safety gear and would strive to educate people about why bike stunts should never be performed in public places,” explains Kalandar. He has not only been a part of their stunt performances but of their adventure rides as well. The group has a sizeable number of students too. Mahesh, a student, joined the group in 2008. “It was the thrill of speed and the urge to perform some of the stunts that made me sign up with the group. But my approach towards stunt riding and interpretation of speed changed after I began training with the group. The emphasis on safety impressed me and changed my perspective towards a lot of things,” he says. Mahesh informs that the team always performs stunts in an open space in the outskirts of the city only after getting all the required clearances, including police permission.

Most of the bikes used by the team to perform have been modified, explains Dempsy, one of the founder members of the team. “The rear brakes have been connected to the handle bar to enable the rider to operate without any extra effort. The crash guard has been extended to help riders stand on it while doing the stunts. The jackets also have elbow guards and if the stunts are too dangerous, then there’s a chest padding available as well. The riders never venture out without wearing their knee guards and helmets,” explains Dempsy.

The extreme nature of stunt riding and the showmanship is what got Rizwan, another student, to become a member of the group. “I always dreamt of performing such daring stunts but never thought I would be able to do it myself. I’ve managed to overcome my fear and indulge in some extreme action after joining the group,” shares Rizwan.

"JAN 02 2017, 23:37 IST",Metrolife,"Anila Kurian Jan 03 , 2017, DHNS,",Whipping up goodness,"I grew up in a place where food played an important part in my life. I was exposed to different varieties of food and my mother would often try making her own version of dishes at home. That is probably how I became interested in cooking as well. When I moved out of my home and began living in Mumbai, I started preparing my own food. I like making my own version of dishes and also adding healthy elements to them. This daily activity slowly encouraged me to start baking as well.

I took it very seriously when I volunteered to take baking classes for an NGO. I realised that making healthier versions of dishes was a much better choice for the kids. In 2012, I started ‘Ovenderful’, a blog on baking. And after a couple of experiments and encouragement from people around me, I decided to make it commercial. Now I take orders from clients and make sure to use only healthy ingredients for my baked goodies.

The one incident that changed my way of baking was when a mother approached me to bake a cake for her eight-year-old son’s birthday. Though it doesn’t sound complicated at all, the young boy had a different story to tell. He was allergic to almost everything that can be added to a cake — dairy products, its associates, gluten and nuts. It was an incredibly challenging task for me to make something for him.

However, by talking to the mother and understanding what I could work with, I made a gluten-free vegan strawberry cake. I prepared a trial batch before the party and waited for a week to ensure that there were no allergic reactions. The boy loved the cake so much that he ordered it again for his sister’s birthday! That’s why baking makes me happy. I am able to spread joy through what I do to the people who enjoy sweets. What many don’t realise is that they can enjoy sweets by substituting certain ingredients with healthier products. That’s what I aim to do in the future.

It’s important to understand the cooking process of the dish you are going to bake. I always visualise what my final product will be like and keep testing it all the way through to get the right texture. While many believe that baking is like a science experimentation, for me, it is about adding your own elements to the dish to make it how you want it to be. My favourite part of baking is making my own version of traditional desserts. The ‘Baked New York Cheesecake’ is one of the most popular desserts in the world and I am glad that I can enjoy it without feeling guilty.

"JAN 02 2017, 23:40 IST",Metrolife,"Jan 03 , 2017,",'I've never been offered romcoms',"Actor Shruti Haasan says she strongly believes in the charm of old-world romance, something which today’s internet-savvy generation is missing. The actor recalls a conversation she had with her father Kamal Haasan who pointed out that in his days, love blossomed outside cellphone screens. “I was talking to my dad and he said half of the love stories happened because we didn’t have WhatsApp and we had to actually meet and talk. I remember the Nokia phones, the SMSes. There was the landline and the romance was that the guy calls you and you’re hoping your mom shouldn’t answer. I don’t think this generation has that and it is sad,” Shruti said.

It was the simplicity of romance which instantly attracted the 28-year-old to be a part of the forthcoming film ‘Behen Hogi Teri’. “I love those times we had. My idea of romance is pretty old school. I loved that element in ‘Behen Hogi Teri’. The freshness and simplicity is beautiful in this film. I love romantic comedies. If I am home and want to watch something, I would probably watch a romantic comedy. Surprisingly, I’ve never been offered rom-coms.”

Directed by Ajay K Pannalal and backed by Amul Mohan, the movie also stars Rajkummar Rao. Shruti, who has acted in Hindi films like ‘D Day’, ‘Welcome Back’ and ‘Gabbar is Back’, says the film tries to show a side of romance which is important to revisit. “I really found the narration funny. It rarely happens when you read or hear something which truly cracks you up. I thought the film really takes us back to simpler times, which we all need considering how complicated we have become.” In the film, she will be seen as the love interest of Rajkummar.

“My character is boisterous. She is a tough cookie but also sensitive. I really liked that. I couldn’t relate to everything, but maybe that’s never been my priority to relate to the character. It’s about empathising with the character’s emotions and playing it out.”"

He’s an intelligent guy but his only problem is that he doesn’t speak good English. The movie delves into the emotions exchanged between the two people.

What got you to sign ‘Mubaraka’?
It’s the script which deals with a lot of issues that are relevant to our times. There’s a blend of comedy, romance and action. I can’t give away too many details about my character but all I can say is that this role has given me the opportunity to explore another side of myself that I didn’t know existed.

What do you do when you are not working?  
I am like a child when I am on the sets. I am curious about everything that is happening around me, both in front of the camera and behind it. You can never find me sitting still when I am on a shoot. But when I am by myself, you wouldn’t find a more boring person than me.

Do you think people in Bengaluru are fashion conscious?
Looks like fashion is ingrained in the sensibilities of young people in Bengaluru. I found that even the most ordinary people here make concerted efforts to wear something wacky and cool at all times. Every city has its own culture when it comes to fashion and Bengaluru is no exception.

Your fashion sense...
I dress to not only look good but also insist that I must feel comfortable in whatever I am wearing. I don’t intend to unleash any trend of sorts but pick up clothes that grab my attention, which could be anything from cool shorts to something very formal."
"JAN 02 2017, 23:46 IST",Metrolife,"Anila Kurian Jan 03 , 2017, DHNS,",Firing up a passion,"Movies often show how simple it is to run to your boss, resign from your job and chase your passion. The hero or heroine automatically find opportunities that take them exactly where they want to be in life. While it may sound all too rosy and perfect, in reality there are many considerations that often stop one from doing so. Many hesitate, plan and then plan some more to pursue something that they are truly passionate about.

‘If you really want it, go get it’ is something that we often hear. That is probably the motivation which led some passionate foodies to leave their full-time jobs and do something that they value above all — enter the culinary world. Jeyadra S worked as a master data specialist for almost six years before she decided to take up baking full-time. Sharing her story, she says, “I started baking a year before I quit and fell in love with the process. I would come back home after office and bake. I worked for almost 100 hours a week! But when I was flooded with appreciation and encouragement from my customers, I decided to quit my job and become a full-time baker.”

She presently works under the name ‘Cupcakes, Cakes & Cookies’ where her baked goodies taste as good as they look in pictures. “I never went to a culinary school so with my new life decision, I have a lot more time to learn new techniques and work on my orders. I want to keep improving myself and my work so that I can start a baking studio and cafe soon,” she says. Many who choose a different path in their lives, to do something they are truly passionate about, aren’t professionally trained in that area. They take the help of books, the internet and learn from experience. Before Gautam Krishnankutty entered the culinary world, he was studying International Relations in the US and had planned to become a professor. As a part-time job, he worked at restaurants as the bus boy, cleaning the tables and watching the chefs in the kitchen. When he returned to India, he decided to start a catering business which eventually led him to open ‘Cafe Thulp’.

Looking back at his journey, he says, “The most difficult part was convincing myself that this is what I really wanted to do. But the real motivation was the zero amount of money in the bank account (laughs). I am glad that I chose this profession.” He also says that if he could go back in time and correct things, he would have liked to attend a culinary school. “Learning a few tricks and techniques would have been an advantage. However, given the fact that I have been in this business for a few years now, I am fine learning things from YouTube,” he says. As for the other unplanned startups, Anupam Behera knew what he was getting into before he opened ‘What’s In The Name’.

He worked as a business analyst before he became a full-time entrepreneur. He says, “My business partner and I knew that we had to keep our primary jobs to sustain finances. We had the chefs, the menu and the designing of the restaurant planned out before we came completely on board.” He says one of the biggest change was the lessons he learnt along the way. He explains, “We learnt that no matter what happens, food is the only way to keep the restaurant open. That’s why we make sure that the food is always great and take in suggestions for the same. The first year was a challenge but it is definitely the best decision I’ve made.”

Despite the challenges they had to face, these chefs and bakers are making their dreams come true. After all, as Harriet Tubman once said, ‘Every great dream begins with a dreamer. Always remember, you have within you the strength, the patience and the passion to reach for the stars to change the world.’"

The University Grants Commission (UGC) is in the last leg of its efforts to completely move from the manual processing of the students’ claims to online processing.

It is also going to implement the transfer of study grants into the bank accounts of the beneficiaries under the direct benefit transfer (DBT) programme, nearly two years after the government created a Public Finance Monitoring System (PFMS) seeking the UGC to get data of all beneficiaries uploaded on it.

With the uploading of the existing beneficiaries of the scholarships and fellowships at the PFMS, the commission is now in the process of moving it to a portal created with the partner bank, for direct transfer of the study grants to the students’ bank accounts.

The higher education regulator has been working to make the transfer of all study grants through direct benefit transfer  since the Centre decided to bring all universities, colleges and other higher educational institutions under the PFMS from April 1, 2015, for the timely release of funds to beneficiaries of scholarships and fellowships.

The UGC had also earmarked about 20% of its budget to the PFMS for the direct payment of students’ study grants as well as development grants to higher educational institutions.

However, the directive to the educational institutions for uploading data of the beneficiary students drew a cold response

As a large number of universities and colleges neither register themselves at the PFMS portal nor furnish beneficiaries’ data for more than a year, the commission went tough and stopped the release of funds earmarked for study grants to such institutions.

A total of 4,595 agricultural labourers also took their lives, taking the total number of suicides in the farming sector to 12,602, an increase from the 12,360 in 2014, according to the ‘Accidental Deaths and Suicides in India 2015’ report.

Bankruptcy, debt and farming-related issues alone accounted for 58.18% (4,659) suicides, a trend which was witnessed in the previous years, too.

“The highly erratic/inadequate monsoon in the last two to three years has aggravated the problems for persons engaged in the farming sector, manifestations of these in extreme situations can be seen in the form of farmers’ suicides,” the report by National Crime Records Bureau said.

The majority of farmers’ suicides were reported in Maharashtra (3,030), followed by Telangana (1,358) and Karnataka (1,197). But if one adds the suicides of agricultural labourers, Karnataka rises to second position (1,569), only below Maharashtra (4,291).

An analysis of the figures showed a reversal in the trend in suicides among farmers and labourers.

While in 2014, the number of suicides of labourers (6,710) was higher compared to that of the farmers (5,650), it was reversed in 2015.

When it comes to the cause of suicides among farmers, Karnataka had more reasons to worry as 79% (946 out of 1,197) suicides were due to bankruptcy or debt.

This was also the cause for 42.7% suicides in Maharashtra and 46.5% in Telangana.

Nanda and Agarwal decried their expulsions and said Mulayam had been “mentally captured” by some people.

“It seems Mulayam is controlled by others. He has been mentally captured,” Agarwal told a news agency.

Nanda said Mulayam had no authority to expel him.

“Our army seeks peace and tranquility along the borders but it does not mean we are weak. We are capable and powerful in all forms and if need be, we will not shy away from using our power in any form,” Gen Rawat said here after inspecting his first ceremonial guard of honour.

“Our aim is to maintain peace at the border. But I will say it again that if need be, we will not hesitate in using our power,” said the new chief, who was one of the brains behind the “surgical strikes” on terror camps across the Line of Control.

Commissioned in the fifth battalion of the 11 Gorkha Rifles in December 1978, Gen Rawat commanded an infantry battalion, along the Line of Actual Control in the eastern sector; a Rashtriya Rifles sector and an infantry division in the Kashmir valley; a Corps in the eastern theater and the Southern Command before being appointed as the vice chief in August.

Situation worsened
The 27th Chief of the Indian Army assumed charges at a time when the security situation in Jammu and Kashmir worsened following the killing of militant leader Burhan Wani in July.

The total number of security personnel killed in Jammu and Kashmir was 63 (23 at the LoC and 30 in the hinterland). In comparison, the numbers were 33 (four at LoC and 29 in the hinterland) in 2015 and 32 (three at LoC and 27 in other parts of the state) in 2014, sources said. The Indian Army killed 141 terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir in 2016.

They have worked with me shoulder-to-shoulder and I can say it for certain that they will continue to work shoulder-to-shoulder to keep the unity and power of the army in the future also.”

“India remains committed to addressing with Pakistan on priority the humanitarian matters, including those pertaining to prisoners and fishermen in each other’s country. In this context, we await from Pakistan the confirmation of nationality of those in India’s custody, who are otherwise eligible for release and repatriation,” the Ministry of External Affairs said in a press-release on Sunday.

New Delhi used the opportunity to once again press Islamabad to grant consular access to Hamid Nehal Ansari and Kulbhushan Yadav, the two Indian nationals currently imprisoned in Pakistan for reportedly involved in espionage.

Ansari, 31, who hails from Mumbai, was arrested in Pakistan in 2012, after he illegally entered the country from Afghanistan. He was convicted of espionage by a court in Pakistan and sent to prison for three years.

He was attacked and injured by the inmates of the Peshawar Central Prison in Pakistan at least thrice. New Delhi conveyed to Islamabad in early 2016 that Ansari should be released from the prison in Pakistan and repatriated to India, since his sentence of three years was already over.

The Congress accused Modi of re-packaging the initiatives taken by the UPA government which were not implemented in the true spirit by the NDA dispensation.

Information and Broadcasting Minister Venkaiah Naidu hit out at the Congress saying the main Opposition party was “unable to digest” the benefits the poor would get after the announcements in the prime minister’s speech on Saturday.

“The announcements made by the prime minister will benefit ‘gaon’ (village), ‘gareeb’ (poor) and ‘kisan’ (farmers) and all other sections of the society,” Home Minister Rajnath Singh said in a statement.

The Congress pointed out that two announcements – Rs 6,000 through bank transfer to pregnant women and 4% rebate on housing loans of the poor – were initiatives taken by the UPA under the then prime minister Manmohan Singh.

“The prime minister did not start new schemes at all,” former Maharashtra chief minister Prithviraj Chavan told a press conference here. “These schemes were started during the UPA regime.”

The Congress said it would intensify protests against the government as the prime minister had “failed” to acknowledge the agrarian distress.

“The prime minister’s address to the nation has left us with no option but to intensify our agitation and go to the people,” said Ahmed Patel, political secretary to Congress president Sonia Gandhi.

affected by demonetisation.

The desert state, immensely popular even among NRIs for solemnising marriages, recorded a huge dip.

Majority of the big fat weddings have been postponed and new dates are yet to be decided.

Wedding planners claim that the winter of 2016 has brought them heavy losses. Usually November and December are auspicious for weddings and the archaeological and scenic beauty of Rajasthan beckons people from all over the world to choose from a plethora of beautiful venues.

Mohit Sand, a wedding planner and president of Rajasthan Event Management, told DH: “Demonetisation has severely affected wedding-related businesses in Rajasthan this season. Around 80% of the domestic weddings got cancelled while the NRI weddings have been equally affected. For the NRIs, December is the  perfect time for a destination wedding in India owing to Christmas break in the US and other western countries.”

The cancellations have had a cascading effect on hotel business as well.
“We had booked different hotels and forts in Udaipur, Jodhpur and Jaipur but all events have been postponed and there is no confirmation from the clients about the new dates,” Sand added.

One-day affairs
Most of the lavish weddings were cut short to one-day affairs, that too without the customary band, elephants and camels.

Rahul Gaur of Rajasthan,  known for organising weddings all over India, told DH, “Most of the weddings got postponed whereas some of them that took place were downsized. The rituals were minus mehndi, sangeet and haldi ceremony.”

Apart from planners and hoteliers, other occupations associated with wedding ceremonies equally affected are caterers, light decorators, DJs, florists, elephant and horse owners etc.

“The daily wagers such as florists and those associated with bands were badly hit since there was no cash flow  in the market and their wages were stuck,” Gaur added.

Most of the weddings usually see a gathering of 1,000-1,500 people but in times of demonetisation, only 300-350 guests were invited.

And the impact may carry forward as the wedding planners are worried about bookings for next year too.

Sand said, “Usually, by now we used to have a fair idea about next year’s weddings
in June and July but this year there are no pre-bookings and not even a single query has come from the clients.”

Rajasthan, known as the exotic wedding destination, hosted actor Elizabeth Hurley and NRI tycoon Arun Nayar’s wedding in 2007.

Similarly, singer Katy Perry and comedian Russell Brand chose Ranthambore to solemnise their wedding while another regal wedding of New York hotelier Vikram Chatwal and Priya Sachdev took place in Zenana Mahal of City Palace in Udaipur.

finally split.

Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav on Sunday dethroned his father and party supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav in a ‘political coup’ of sorts and anointed himself as SP’s national president at an emergency national convention of the party here.

Akhilesh’s anointment triggered an all-out war in the family and Mulayam hit back by expelling SP general secretary Ram Gopal Yadav, an Akhilesh supporter, from the party again and terming the convention and his removal “unconstitutional”.

Mulayam also convened an emergency national convention of the party here on Thursday to “ensure” that there was no “confusion” among  the public.

Earlier in the day, the national convention unanimously adopted four resolutions, that included electing Akhilesh as national president of the party, Mulayam as ‘margdarshak’ (mentor), removal of Shivpal Singh Yadav as state unit chief and expulsion of SP Rajya Sabha MP Amar Singh.

An emotional Akhilesh said that there was a “conspiracy” by some people to “finish” the party and vowed to defeat “such forces”. “People (read Shivpal) brought typewriter from their residence to type my expulsion letter,” he said.

He said that he would “respect” Mulayam “more than before”. “Netaji (Mulayam) is my father...no one can come between our relationship....I will make any sacrifice to save the party and the family,” he added.

Akhilesh, apparently explaining the hurry in removing Mulayam and Shivpal, and expelling Amar Singh, said that the next three-four months were “crucial” for the party and apprehended that Mulayam could have been forced to do something that would have harmed the SP.

“Na jane kaun milke kya faisla karwa le...kya type karwa le,” (Netaji may be forced to take decisions by some one), he said, apparently referring to Shivpal and Amar Singh.

Ram Gopal, who moved the resolutions, said that two persons had been behind the “conspiracy” to damage the SP. “These two did not want SP to return to power,” he said.

Ram Gopal said that the Assembly polls nominees were selected without the approval of the Parliamentary Board. He also said that the resolutions would be sent to the Election Commission (EC) for necessary action.

Almost all Mulayam loyalists, legislators and ministers, and office bearers from different states were present at the convention, clearly signaling that Akhilesh had the numbers.

A little later, Mulayam hit back expelling Ram Gopal, which was third in two months. He also called the convention and the resolutions “unconstitutional”.

“Some people have been humiliating me to hide their sins and benefit BJP in the polls,” he said.

Senior SP leaders, who attended Sunday’s convention, urged Mulayam to “understand” the ground reality. “No one has the authority to expel Ram Gopal,” said SP leader Naresh Agarwal.

SP vice president Kironmoy Nanda, veteran SP leader Reoti Raman Singh, more than 200 SP MLAs, including ministers, were present at the convention.

Punjab National Bank (PNB), too, followed suit after India’s largest public sector bank announced its decision.

“The bank has reduced marginal cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR) by 0.9% from 8.90% to 8% for one-year tenure,” SBI said.

MCLR is the benchmark lending rate based on which interest rate for loans is fixed.
This is the steepest one-time cut in the SBI benchmark rate in the recent years. The bank has so far reduced the benchmark rate by 2% since January 2015. The reduction comes in the wake of banks flush with deposits post demonetisation.

The SBI is expected to announce revised rates for home and car loans on Monday.
The PNB reduced its one-year MCLR rate by 0.7% to 8.45%, effective Sunday. IDBI and State Bank of Travancore had on Friday reduced their benchmark lending rates by 15 and 30 basis points, respectively. Union Bank of India, too, cut it up to 90 basis points.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his address to the nation on Saturday, had asked banks to utilise the “golden opportunity of historical cash reserves in their chests” and lend to poor and middle class.

“History is witness that the Indian banking system has never received such a large amount of money, in such a short time...I appeal to them to move beyond their traditional priorities, and keep the poor, the lower middle class, and the middle class at the focus of their activities,” the prime minister said on Saturday.

Demand for homes and vehicles came down heavily after discretionary spendings of people suffered due to limits imposed on currency withdrawals from banks post November 8 ban on high denomination notes.

India’s largest car maker Maruti Suzuki’s bookings dropped by 20% in November. The second largest car maker Hyundai too reported a significant fall in bookings.
Auto experts said December sales are expected to be muted.

According to bankers, the cut in lending rates will spur demand for retail and corporate loans and kick start economic activities temporarily halted due to demonetisation."

""Cycle symbol is ours,"" asserted Mulayam and asked party cadres to focus on winning the assembly elections likely to be announced any day now Mulayam, who postponed the SP convention scheduled in Lucknow on January 5, said, ""No one can accuse me of wrongdoing. I have never indulged in corruption or betrayed anyone. Cycle symbol is ours.""

The Mulayam camp is likely to meet senior EC officials between 4 PM and 5 PM in Delhi.
Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, who yesterday sought to take control over the SP, remained closeted with his confidants and is expected to meet party leaders and legislators at this residence in Lucknow.

Sources said Ram Gopal might represent Akhilesh when he takes up the symbol issue with the EC.

In a series of tweets, SP leader Shivpal Yadav, the warring uncle of Akhilesh, maintained that Mulayam is the SP national president even now.

Shivpal gave no reasons for the abrupt postponement of the party convention, but insiders said perhaps the Mulayam camp was apprehensive of a poor turnout compared to the massive gathering at the ""convention"" held by Ram Gopal Yadav yesterday. The convention was declared illegal and unconstitutional by Mulayam.

The Samajwadi Party yesterday split down the middle with the faction headed by Chief Minister Akhilesh removing Mulayam as party chief and appointing him in his place at a convention in which the group claimed support of the majority of legislators and district units.

The two sides had engaged in mutual recriminatory expulsions with the convention called by Ram Gopal removing Akhilesh's warring uncle Shivpal as state party chief, and showing the door to ""outsider"" Amar Singh, who has been blamed for the feud in the Yadav clan.

Mulayam had retorted by again expelling his cousin Ram Gopal for six years along with national vice president Kiranmoy Nanda, who chaired the convention, and general secretary Naresh Agarwal for taking part in it.

Amar and Shivpal this morning reached Delhi to fine tune the strategy to ensure that the symbol remains with Mulayam ahead of assembly polls in the state.

Talking to reporters after returning from London, Amar said, ""I was and will remain with Mulayam Singh Yadav. I was a hero but I am now ready to become a khalnayak (villain) for him.""

Asked about his expulsion from the party by the Akhilesh camp, Amar said he will be ""hurt"" only if Mulayam says anything against him.

Shivpal, who has been removed as the UP unit chief of SP by the Akhilesh camp, said he would continue to be with Mulayam. ""I will be with Mulayam till my last breath,"" he said upon his arrival in Delhi.

The two, along with Mulayam and a few other leaders, will meet in the afternoon before approaching the Election Commission to ensure the symbol remains with Mulayam and is neither frozen or given to the Akhilesh camp.

Nanda today said Mulayam is leader of all samajwadis and they will contest assembly polls under Akhilesh Yadav.

""Netaji (Mualayam) is leader of all of us samajwadis. We will contest assembly polls under our national president Akhilesh Yadav, who is our Chief Minister and has done a lot of work for the state,"" Nanda, who was sacked by Mulayam from the party for attending Ram Gopal's convention, told reporters here.

On Amar Singh, Nanda said, ""He wants to break heart of 'netaji'. He is used to visiting London, Paris, America...What can is say about him...""

When asked about Shivpal, he said, ""What can he do. He is with 'netaji'. We all are also with netaji..."""

"JAN 02 2017, 11:27 IST",National,"New Delhi, Jan 2, 2016, (PTI),","Cannot seek votes in name of religion, caste: SC","In a majority verdict, the Supreme Court today held that any appeal for votes on the ground of ""religion, race, caste, community or language"" amounted to ""corrupt practice"" under the election law provision.

Referring to the term 'his religion' used in section 123(3) of the Representation of The Peoples (RP) Act, which deals with 'corrupt practice', Chief Justice T S Thakur and three others in the 4:3 verdict said it meant the religion and caste of all including voters, candidates and their agents etc.

However, the minority view of three judges -  UU Lalit, A K Goel and D Y Chandrachud - held that the term 'his' religion means religion of candidate only.

The majority view, also shared by Justices M B Lokur, S A Bobde and L N Rao, said 'secularism' has to be considered while dealing with such issues


The apex court had on October 27 reserved its verdict on the ""width and scope"" of an electoral law provision dealing with the issue whether seeking votes or asking electors not to vote on the ground of ""religion, race, caste, community or language"", amounted to ""corrupt practice"".

It has been interpreted in an earlier verdict that the term 'his religion', used in section 123(3) of the RP Act which deals with 'corrupt practice', meant the faith of the candidates only.

Section 123(3) of the RP Act, which is being scrutinised, reads: ""The appeal by a candidate or his agent or by any other person with the consent of a candidate or his election agent to vote or refrain from voting for any person on the ground of his religion, race, caste, community or language or the use of, or appeal to religious symbols or the use of, or appeal to, national symbols..., for furtherance of the prospects of the election of that candidate or for prejudicially affecting the election of any candidate"" would amount to corrupt practices.

The bench had said there is freedom to ""practice and propagate"" the religion, but asked ""can it (religion) be used for electoral purposes"".

The bench was hearing a batch of petitions including the one filed by Abhiram Singh whose election as an MLA in 1990 on BJP ticket from Santacruz Assembly seat in Mumbai was set aside by the Bombay High Court.

The apex court in February 2014 had tagged Abhiram Singh's petition with others in which the five judge bench had decided in 2002 to re-visit its 20-year old 'Hindutva' judgement for an authoritative pronouncement on electoral laws by a seven-judge bench.

The issue of interpretation of section 123(3) arose on January 30, 2014 before a five-judge which referred it for examination before a larger bench of seven judges.

A three-judge bench on April 16, 1992 had referred to a five-judge Constitution bench Singh's appeal in which the same question and interpretation of Section 123(3) was raised.

While the five-judge bench was hearing this matter on January 30, 2014, it was informed that an identical issue was raised in an election petition filed by Narayan Singh against BJP leader Sunderlal Patwa. Another Constitution Bench of five judges of the apex court had referred it to a larger bench of seven judges.

Thereafter, the five-judge bench had referred Singh's matter also to the Chief Justice for placing it before a seven-judge bench."
"JAN 02 2017, 11:42 IST",National,"New Delhi, Jan 2, 2017, PTI,",Beleaguered BCCI top honchos accept SC verdict,"Given the marching orders by Supreme Court, the sacked duo of BCCI President Anurag Thakur and Secretary Ajay Shirke today said they will abide by the directive even though they made their skepticism with the verdict quite apparent.

Thakur and Shirke were told to quit office with immediate effect by an irate Supreme Court, which held that it was mandatory for the BCCI to implement the Lodha Committee recommendations on administrative reforms in toto.

The court ruled that, for the time being, the senior-most vice President of the BCCI will act as the stand-in President and the joint Secretary would carry out the Secretary's functions. DDCA Vice President CK Khanna, 64, is among the seniormost VPs in the Board right now.

The apex court also issued a contempt notice to Thakur seeking his response as to why he should not be held liable for obstructing the implementation of the Lodha reforms, which were first made mandatory on July 18 last year.

Thakur took a subtle dig at the order saying that if the apex court feels the cricketing body will do well under the guidance of retired judges, ""I wish them all the best"".

""For me it was not a personal battle, it was a battle for the autonomy of the sports body. I respect Supreme Court as any citizen should. If Supreme Court judges feel that BCCI could do better under retired judges, I wish them all the best. I am sure Indian cricket will do well under their guidance,"" said Thakur.

He reacted to the Supreme Court order by putting up a video clip on social media.
""My commitment to the best of Indian cricket and autonomy of sports will always remain,"" he said.

Thakur was BCCI joint secretary and secretary before being elected president in May 2016. The BJP MP has also served as Himachal cricket boss for more than a decade.

""I had the honour of serving Indian cricket. Over the years, Indian cricket saw its best in terms of administration and development of the game. BCCI is the best managed sports organisation in the country with defined procedures. India has the best infrastructure built and maintained by state association with help of BCCI. India has more quality players than anywhere in the world.

Shirke, on the other hand, said he is ""absolutely fine"" with the Supreme Court order but hoped that the Board does not lose its international standing owing to the administrative upheaval here.

""I have no reaction to that (to his sacking). If that is the Supreme Court order, I cease to be secretary. It cannot get any simpler than that. My role in BCCI is over,"" said Shirke shortly after Supreme Court removed him and president Anurag Thakur as the office-bearers of the BCCI.

The two faced the wrath of the Supreme Court after BCCI failed to implement the Lodha panel reforms under their leadership.

When asked whether the situation could have been avoided had the Board implemented the sweeping reforms earlier, Shirke said there was no question of handling the issue differently.

""At the end of the day, the BCCI comprises of members. It is not about me or the president. It is about the members.

""I have no reason to go into history. History can be judged by people differently. I have no personal attachment to the post. In the past also I have resigned and I have lots of other things to do. I came back to the Board as there was a vacancy and I was elected unopposed. Now it has come to this (the Supreme Court). I am completely fine with it and I have no regrets,"" said Shirke from the UK.

A bench headed by Chief Justice T S Thakur said the working of BCCI will be looked after by a committee of administrators and requested senior advocate Fali S Nariman and senior advocate Gopal Subramanian, the amicus curiae in the matter, to assist the court in nominating persons of impeccable integrity for the panel.

Shrike hoped the Board does not lose its powerful position on the global stage.

""I hope the new dispensation continues the good work done by the BCCI. Hope the Board doesn't lose more face globally. I also hope the Indian team is able to maintain its supremacy in all three formats of the game,"" Shirke added.

Justice R M Lodha, who headed the three-member panel formed by Supreme Court to suggest structural reforms in the BCCI, said it was only a matter of time for the recommendations to be implemented.

""This is a logical consequence because once the reforms were accepted by the Supreme Court, they had to be implemented. There were obstructions and obviously this had to happen and it has happened,"" said Lodha.

""One should understand that once the order of the Supreme Court has come, it has to be obeyed. It is law of the land. It is victory for cricket. The game will flourish. Administrators come and go but the game goes on,"" Lodha added.

The Supreme Court bench, also comprising Justices A M Khanwilkar and D Y Chandrachud, said that Nariman and Subramanian will complete the task in two weeks and the matter for passing the direction for nominating the persons in committee of administrators will be taken up on January 19.

Meanwhile, the cricketing fraternity led by former India spinner Bishan Bedi hailed the apex court's verdict.

""This is a landmark judgement. It is good for Indian cricket and it will be back on track. There is light now and we are thankful to the Supreme Court. I don't have to get into debate. This is full and final. This is going to be great news for Indian sports and cricket in particular. If you are watching IOA, it is in shambles. That will be clarified too,"" said Bedi.

The Lodha committee recommendations on one state one vote was one of the most opposed by the BCCI, especially its affiliate Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA).

Sharad Pawar, who resigned as MCA president last month to adhere to age cap of 70 years recommended by the Lodha, was left disappointed after the Supreme Court order today.

Implementing one-state one-vote would mean Mumbai, Maharashtra and Vidarbha will have to right to vote on rotational basis.

""It is the saddest day for Mumbai cricket. Mumbai cricket has produced so many international stars and done so much for Indian cricket (including record 41 time Ranji champions). The decision to keep Mumbai away from voting is painful,"" said Pawar.

Veteran administrator Niranjan Shah, who is secretary of Saurashtra Cricket Association, said there was no option other than implementing the Lodha reforms.

""Whatever Supreme Court says is final. We will have to abide by that,"" said Shah.

Tamil Nadu Cricket Association secretary Kasi Viswanathan too concurred with his Saurashtra counterpart, saying the body will adopt Lodha recommendations.

""We will have to go by what the Supreme Court has ordered. Anything else will be contempt of court. It has to be followed. We will soon call for a Special General Meeting to chart the road ahead,"" Viswanathan told PTI.

Brijesh Patel, secretary of the Karnataka State Cricket Association (KSCA), said they were awaiting a copy of the Supreme Court order.

""I can't say anything until I read the order. Only after going through the order we can discuss the road ahead,"" Patel told PTI when asked whether KSCA would implement the Lodha reforms.

However, rattled by the verdict, senior BCCI vice President Gokaraju Ganga Raju today made it clear that his association Andhra CA will implement Lodha Reforms with immediate effect.

""There is no confusion as Supreme Court has passed it's verdict. As the president of Andhra Cricket Association we would implement Lodha Reforms in totality with immediate effect. If it means that we have to go into cooling off period, so be it. Indian cricket should move forward,"" Ganga Raju told PTI today.

There is speculation that he might be in line for interim president's post after Supreme Court removed Anurag Thakur today but he does not want to get into it.

""Look, I still need some clarity over the matter. Mr CK Khanna of DDCA is also a senior VP. But in any case it will be a temporary post as I will also have to go into compulsory cooling off period. But if such kind of responsibility is entrusted on me, I will perform my duties with utmost honesty and sincerity,"" Ganga Raju said."
"JAN 02 2017, 13:35 IST",National,"Balasore (Odisha), Jan 2, 2016, (PTI),",India successfully test fires Agni-IV ballastic missile," India today successfully test-fired its nuclear-capable strategic ballistic missile Agni-IV with a strike range of 4000 km as part of a user trial from a test range off Odisha coast
.

Supported by a mobile launcher, the surface-to-surface missile was flight tested from launch complex-4 of the Integrated Test Range (ITR) at Dr Abdul Kalam Island, formerly known as Wheeler Island, at about 11.55 hours, Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) sources said.

Describing the trial as successful, they said this was the 6th trial of the indigenously developed Agni-IV missile which met the mission objectives. The last trial conducted by the specially formed strategic force command (SFC) of Indian Army on November 9, 2015 was also successful.

The sleek missile having 4000 km strike range is a two stage missile. It is 20 meter-long weighing 17 tonnes.

""The sophisticated surface-to-surface missile is equipped with modern and compact avionics to provide high level of reliability,"" DRDO sources said.

Agni-IV missile is equipped with state-of-the-art Avionics, 5th generation on board computer and distributed architecture. It has the latest features to correct and guide itself for in-flight disturbances.

The most accurate Ring Laser Gyro based Inertial Navigation System (RINS) and supported by highly reliable redundant Micro Navigation System (MINGS), ensures the vehicle reaches the target within two digit accuracy, they said.

The re-entry heat shield can withstand temperatures in the range of 4000 degree centigrade and makes sure the avionics function normally with inside temperature remaining less than 50 degree centigrade. Ballistic missiles like Agni-I, II and III and Prithvi are already in the arsenal of armed forces, giving India an effective deterrence capability.

Radars and electro-optical systems had been positioned along the coast of Odisha for tracking and monitoring all the parameters of the missile, the sources said, adding two Indian naval ships anchored near the target area to witness the final event.

The successful trial of Agni IV came close on the heels of a similar test on December 26, 2016 of long range missile Agni 5 which was successfully carried out from the same launch site."
"JAN 02 2017, 14:49 IST",National,"Chennai, Jan 2, 2017, PTI,",LS deputy speaker Thambidurai appeals to Sasikala to become CM,"Senior AIADMK leader M Thambidurai today appealed to the newly appointed party general secretary V K Sasikala to become Tamil Nadu Chief Minister, saying the leadership in both the party and governance should be with the same person.

Speaking to reporters after calling on Sasikala, the Lok Sabha Deputy Speaker also cited the ongoing political tussle in the Samajwadi party in Uttar Pradesh to drive home his point that the control of government and party should vest in the same person.

""Now you see problem has cropped up in Uttar Pradesh, the party was with father and government with son that is why the leadership of both the party and governance should be with the same person,"" he said replying to a question.

Thambidurai met the AIADMK chief at Poes Garden residence of her mentor J Jayalalithaa and gave her a representation urging her to take over as CM. Sasikala becoming the Chief Minister was only ""natural and just"", he said.

Sasikala, appointed as General Secretary by the AIADMK's top decision-making body General Council on December 29, took charge of the post on December 31, pledging to take forward the legacy of Jayalalithaa.

Already, almost all state ministers, part of the O Panneerselvam cabinet, have made similar appeals urging Sasikala to take over as Tamil Nadu Chief Minister.

Thambidurai said he appealed to Sasikala to become Chief Minister just like her mentor.
He said ""Chinamma"", as Sasikala is called by partymen, was a ""deserving and eligible person"" and that was why she was appointed party general secretary.

""Only on that basis (she is the eligible person) we are appealing again to her to take on the reigns of governance too... This is because the responsibility of governing the party and the government should lie with the same person,"" he said.

 
""I have made a request that Chinnamma (Sasikala) should immediately assume the post of Tamil Nadu Chief Minister to take forward the work of Amma (Jayalalithaa) in both the party and governance,"" Thambidurai said.

Asked about the response of Sasikala, he said,""I have made my request as a party worker and given my representation. She did not give any reply.""

Stating that a party comes to power for doing good to people by giving electoral promises, he said ""It is my opinion that such promises could be fulfilled in the best manner only by the person with whom the party top position is vested.""

Giving past examples from the country's political history that it was the party chief who became the executive head of the government too at Centre and States, he said 'Amma', who was the party supremo became Chief Minister when the party was voted to power.

""Since she is the party chief, it is only natural that she also becomes the Chief Minister, it is just,"" he added.

After the demise of Jayalalithaa on December 5, Panneerselvam was elected as the AIADMK legislature party leader and sworn in as Chief Minister at the same time. 

Thambidurai hailed Sasikala as a ""lighthouse"" on whom he and all the party workers had ""unshakable faith and confidence that Chinnamma alone would continue to implement the several welfare schemes"" initiated by AIADMK founder MGR and former chief minister J Jayalalithaa.

Praising her for her ""intelligence and political acumen"", he said Sasikala had the ability to take decisions ""without any likes or dislikes"".

""We have seen that the people in India have not accepted a situation, wherein the leadership of the party is in one hand and that of the government in another,"" he said.

In a press note on his official letter pad of the office of the Lok Sabha Deputy Speaker (the gist of which he had briefed reporters about), Thambidurai said in the past, some governments had faced several hurdles when the government and the party leadership were in different hands.

Such regimes were rendered incapable of ""delivering on its promises and lost credibility among the people when the leaderships of the (ruling) party and the government were in the hands of two different persons"", he claimed.

""Unfinished tasks of the party and the government, as expected by Puratchi Thalaivi Amma (Jayalalithaa), will be completed only when the leadership of the party and that of the government are in the hand of one person,"" the AIADMK leader said.

Referring to the 2019 Parliamentary polls, he said, ""To continue to win elections, as was done by Puratchi Thalaivar (MGR) and Puratchi Thalaivi, I emphatically request that respected Chinnamma immediately takes over as the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu."" "

Additional City Civil and Sessions Court Judge N R  Channakeshava had directed the Congress leader to be present on December 13, but he did not appear.

Bengaluru-based businessman M K Kuruvilla had filed a petition in 2015 seeking return of Rs 1,60,85,700 deposited with SCOSSA Educational Consultants Private Limited, the first defendant, for setting up a solar power project in Kerala.

As the hearing resumed, counsel for Kuruvilla sought time for studying the affidavit submitted by Chandy. Kuruvilla's counsel, in his submissions, alleged that the copy of the affidavit given to him was different from the one which was submitted to the court today.
""Hence, we seek time for studying the affidavit, as it is different from the copy of the affidavit we received sometimes back,"" he said.

Sustaining the plea, the judge adjourned the matter to January nine and directed Chandy to appear before him for cross-examination. On October 24, the court had directed six persons, including Chandy, and a firm to together pay an amount of Rs 1,60,85,700 to Kuruvilla, with 12 per cent interest, for a solar project that did not materialize.

Chandy had filed two applications appealing against the  earlier verdict. The first plea challenged court's  ex-parte order and the second sought that his arguments be heard.

 Earlier, holding Chandy jointly liable for paying back the money to the petitioner in the case by a firm for a solar  power project which did not materialize, the court had said  ""six defendants, including Chandy and SCOSSA Educational  Consultants Private Limited, shall pay the decreetal (ordered) sum Rs 1,60,85,700 to the plaintiff with current and future interest at 12 per cent per annum.""

The court had said the defendants must comply with the order within six months failing which Kuruvilla will be entitled to recover the determined amount from the defendants, in accordance with law.

The Bengaluru-based businessman, in his petition, had sought Rs 1,60,85,700 with 18 per cent interest per annum on the deposited sum along with court expenses. The court allowed the plea with an interest of 12 per cent."

The court had reminded the BCCI top brass that Thakur as president of the board had asked for a letter from Richardson that the appointment of a CAG nominee in the cricket body would compromise with autonomy and amount to government interference."

National Organisation of Bank Workers (NOBW), an affiliate of Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, in a letter to the Prime Minister said, ""Bank employees have worked 12 to 18 hours a day during the last 50 days. Only few banks have considered overtime for extra working. Kindly advise the management to consider the overtime for beyond working hours worked by bank employees.""

It also called for stepping up recruitment activities and said that banks are understaff for implementing all schemes. NOBW vice president Ashwani Rana also pitched for decent salary hike in the wage revision due in November this year.

""Wage revision of bank employees is due in November 2017. Your government has already advised IBA to implement it on due date. We wish to bring to your kind notice that bank employees are far behind government employees in salary structure.

The apex court said it gives rise to ""speculation and misgivings"" due to continuance of such judges in the same high court and instead of sitting over the recommendation, the Centre should return back to the collegium for reconsideration.

""Continuance of judges in the same high courts despite being transferred is giving rise to speculation and misgivings. If you (the Centre) have any problem with the recommendations then send it back to us. We will look into it. There is no point sitting over it,"" a bench headed by Chief Justice T S Thakur told Attorney General (AG) Mukul Rohatgi.

Justice Thakur, who is demitting office tomorrow as the Chief Justice of India, has been regularly questioning the government over the appointment of judges for higher judiciary and both (the Centre and the judiciary) are at loggerheads with each other over the issue.

The AG said that the collegium has sent back 37 names of judges to the government which is looking at them. ""What about the transfers of judges which has been recommended by the collegium? You are sitting over them for over 10 months,"" a bench also comprising Justices A M Khanwilkar and D Y Chandrachud said.

Rohatgi said he needs to take instructions on the pending recommendations of transfers and sought three weeks of time. Senior advocate Ram Jethmalani said the top law officer of the government should have all the information.

""I have no information about the transfers. Give me some time. I will come back in three weeks with full details,"" Rohatgi said. Jethmalani said that transfer recommendation of Justice M R Shah of the Gujarat High Court is pending since February 2016. ""I do not understand why is the government so interested to keep this man over there,"" he said.

At the outset, senior advocate Yatin Oza said, ""Things are really bad. I cannot say a lot of things in open court in the presence of journalists and media. Recommendations which were made six months after Justice Shah's have seen light of the day."" Oza said that the court should pass some orders on the issue in the interest of justice and institution.

The bench asked the Attorney General to file the status report with detailed reasons in two weeks. The apex court had on November 18, last year said that it has not accepted the Centre's stand of rejecting the 43 names recommended by the Supreme Court Collegium for their appointment as judges of the various high courts and most of the names have been sent back for reconsideration.

The Centre had told the court that it has cleared 34 names out of the 77 recommended by the collegium for appointment as judges in various high courts in the country. Rohatgi, on November 11, had told the court that the Centre had already sent the fresh draft of the Memorandum of Procedure (MoP) for consideration of the collegium on August 3, last year, but so far no response has been received by the government.

The apex court had earlier rapped the government for delay in appointments to higher judiciary despite recommendations made by the collegium in this regard and had said the entire institution cannot be brought to a grinding halt.

Maintaining that the appointment process ""cannot be stalled"" due to non-finalisation of the MoP, the court had criticised the tardy progress in processing files pertaining to judges' appointment and even warned that it may summon the secretaries of the PMO and the Ministry of Law and Justice to ascertain the factual position.

The Attorney General had said that non-finalisation of the MoP was one of the issues and had assured the bench that more progress will be seen in the near future on the appointment of judges.

The apex court had said it would not tolerate ""logjam in judges' appointment"" and would intervene to ""fasten accountability as the justice delivery system is collapsing"". The bench had said that if the government had reservation about any name, it could always come back to the collegium."

""People were under the impression that PM Modi would apply balm on the sufferings faced by them. But, it does not seem Modi was very serious while he was addressing the nation. More than 400 people lost their lives standing in queues. Families of all deceased must be cursing the government,"" an editorial in Sena mouthpiece 'Saamana' said today.

The schemes announced by Modi hold no value for families of those who lost their lives, the ruling ally said.

""Many of the schemes announced by Modi are old and have been running since the UPA regime. For instance, Rs 6,000 announced for women (who undergo institutional delivery) is already running since 2013 under the Food Security Act,"" it said.

The party said there are flaws in schemes announced for farmers as well. ""RBI is not ready to accept the demonetised currency deposited with district co-operative banks. The financial loss, thus, will have to be borne by these banks. Now the PM has announced that loans taken for agriculture will be borne by the government. The question is, how will these banks be able to bear this excessive burden,"" it sought to know.

The Sena said the Centre is yet to pay district banks the compensation for loans they provided during the Kharif season of 2015 and that waiving interest on loans taken during the previous Rabi season would further burden them.

""People were expecting a precise answer from the PM on when the problems being faced by them will end. But possibly, the PM himself does not have any answer. Also, the PM does not have specific figures on how much black money has been retrieved post demonetisation,"" the Sena said."

""Have you ever seen SP and BSP together..if SP says it is sunrise, the BSP will say it is sunset.

There is another party ""whose worry is where to keep money. It is looking for banks far and wide,"" the PM said in an apparent swipe at Mayawati-led BSP, which has come under scanner for alleged huge bank deposits post demonetisation.

""There is this third party which is using all its strength to focus on the family's fate,"" he said referring to the feud in Mulayam Singh Yadav's clan.

""People of UP have to decide if a party whose leaders are busing saving their money will be able to save UP. Or the party which is completely occupied in family (infighting) will be able to save UP.

He also came down heavily on Samajwadi Party government in the state, alleging that it was doing politics at the cost of development and has no time to procure paddy from farmers despite the Centre's support.

Elated over the turnout at the rally, he said not just BJP, but the state's development had been ""exiled"" for 14 years and the situation will change soon.

""People of the state have already seen politics of caste and family... For once rise above caste and vote only for development in the elections and see whether UP changes or not,"" Modi said.
 Starting his speech by eulogising former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee who represented Lucknow in the Lok Sabha, Modi said that the BJP patriarch will be very satisfied to see people's response here.

Invoking Bhimrao Ambedkar, the Prime Minister claimed that some people were troubled when his government launched Bhim mobile app named after the dalit icon.

""Will politics stoop so low..... we launched Bhim mobile app a couple of days ago and named it after Bhimrao Ambedkar who was an expert in economy...if dealings in the future business is named after Bhim why is it troubling some people.""

""I want that we go to villages to all those carrying mobile phone and ask them to download the app and remember Bhim everywhere...this will be the biggest tribute to Bhimrao Ambedkar,"" he said. Referring to his New Year eve address when he launched schemes for the poor, he said some people were troubled by it also. ""They are troubled when Modi takes money and also when gives it (to the poor). Their problem is that their chairs are shaking.

""They have become irrelevant and are looking for lost ground by indulging in politics of opposing,"" he said ,adding that he has taken a resolve to return what has been snatched away from the deprived and middle class.

The fight against corruption will continue till it is fully uprooted and ""so we want the blessings of the people of Uttar Pradesh,"" he said urging the voters to give a majority to BJP in the state polls.

""The central government now takes decisions on its own. The country has got a prime minister, a government whose high command is only people. It has happened for the first time in 30 years that there is a government whose high command is the 125 crore people of India,"" Modi said.

The PM said since he is an MP from the state he has experienced how government is run here. Modi said he was appalled to know that in his own Varanasi constituency works are decided after seeing who has made the recommendation for construction of roads or pathways. ""My MPs have been complaining day and night that their works were not being done by the UP government,"" he said.

""Ever since our government came to power in Delhi every year Rs one lakh crore more had been given to the state through the Finance Commission...had that been used properly a lot of difference would have been made here.... development is not a priority of the state government,"" he said.

Referring to schemes launched for farmers, he said, ""UP government is not ready to take responsibility. They instigate farmers but politics should not be played with the people and it needs to remain confined among political parties.""

""There should not be any politics in development. People have to bear its brunt. Farmers work hard but when central government sets MSP, I have to say with pain that despite all help from the Government of India, UP government has no time to purchase paddy from farmers,"" he said. He said ""the massive turnout"" at the sprawling Ramabai Ambedkar rally sthal showed which way the wind is blowing.

In times when people do not have a long memory, Modi said, people still remember the BJP governments 14 years ago headed by Kalyan Singh, Ram Prakash and Rajnath Singh.
""The issue is not of BJP's exile... the issue is that development had been exiled in the state for 14 years and today I am seeing an opportunity here for development of the state which was necessary for the development of the country,"" he said.

Seeking full majority in the coming elections, Modi said, ""I have to tell people that they should not bring a change which is half-baked and ensure a government with full majority so that there is no impediment in development.""

Questioning the law and order situation in the state, Modi said honest citizens have to worry about criminals, land grabbers and safety of their daughters and sisters. ""BJP governments have shown before and if given a chance my party promises to provide a peaceful life and rule of law in the state,"" he stressed.

These elections could be an issue of who becomes CM or MLA for other parties, but for BJP the coming elections are not about winning or losing, Modi said. ""I want to tell BJP workers that the UP elections are not an issue of victory or defeat but an election which will assign you responsibility for which we have to become capable and move ahead. ""We are going to get this big responsibility,"" Modi said adding parytmen will have to move ahead with the motto of 'sabka saath, sabka vikas'. "
"JAN 02 2017, 17:47 IST",National,"New Delhi, Jan 2, 2016, PTI,",Service charge by hotels/restaurants not mandatory: Govt,"Service charge on a food bill is not compulsory and a customer can choose to have it waived if not satisfied with the experience, the government said today.

The Centre has also asked states to ensure that hotels/ restaurants disseminate this information through displays in their premises.

""A number of complaints from consumers have been received that hotels and restaurants are following the practice of charging 'service charge' in the range of 5-20 per cent, in lieu of tips, which a consumer is forced to pay irrespective of the kind of service provided to him,"" Union Consumer Affairs Ministry said in an official statement.

The Ministry had sought clarification from the Hotel Association of India, which replied that ""service charge is completely discretionary and should a customer be dissatisfied with the dining experience, he/she can have it waived off. Therefore, it is deemed to be accepted voluntarily.""

Highlighting provisions under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, the ministry said this law provides that a trade practice which, for the purpose of promoting the sale, use or the supply of any goods or for the provision of any service, adopts any unfair method or deceptive practice, is to be treated as an unfair trade practice.

A consumer can make a complaint to the appropriate consumer forum against such unfair trade practices.

""The Department of Consumer Affairs has asked the state governments to sensitise the companies, hotels and restaurants in the states regarding aforementioned provisions of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986...

""...and also to advise the hotels/restaurants to disseminate information through display at the appropriate place in the hotels/restaurants that the 'service charges' are discretionary/voluntary and a consumer dissatisfied with the services can have it waived off,"" the statement said."

The Indians who were abroad during the 50-day window provided from November 9 to December 30 to deposit the old currency have been given a 3-month grace period till March 31 and NRIs 6 months till June 30 to deposit the junked notes at RBI's offices in Mumbai, New Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata, and Nagpur.

""For the period from up to March 31, 2017 or June 30, 2017, as applicable, a declaration form will need to be filled by resident Indians and non-resident Indians coming to India and carrying Specified Bank Notes (SBNs) for depositing these SBNs in the specified offices of RBI in India,"" a finance ministry notification said.

A 1-page form has been worked out for the purpose. ""The Customs officer shall strictly count the number of notes and tally the total amount mentioned before stamping the form submitted by the passenger,"" the notification said.

While there is no limit on deposit of SBNs by an Indian national who was abroad when the 50-day window was in operation, NRIs can deposit only Rs 25,000, an RBI notification said.

However, this facility is not available for Indian citizens resident in Nepal, Bhutan, Pakistan and Bangladesh, a separate notification added.

Indians abroad will have to produce a ""copy of passport with immigration stamp as proof of the individual's absence from the country during the period November 9, 2016, to December 30, 2016"" as also copies of all bank account statements evidencing that no SBNs of 500 and 1,000 rupees were deposited during the 50-day window.

Valid ID proof and Aadhaar number along with the applicant's KYC-compliant bank account details are also to be submitted, it said. ""On ascertaining that the tenderer was abroad during the period from November 9, 2016 and December 30, 2016, the account is KYC compliant, fulfilment of other conditions and the genuineness of the notes tendered, admissible amount will be credited to the account under advice to the tenderer,"" the RBI notification said.

For NRIs, in addition to the proof of being outside the country, they will have to produce ""a certificate issued by Indian Customs on arrival through Red Channel after December 30, 2016, indicating the import of SBNs, with details and value thereof""."
"JAN 02 2017, 18:50 IST",National,"Chennai, Jan 2, 2017, PTI,",Not in favour of exhuming Jaya's body: Naidu,"Days after a Madras High Court judge indicated that he may order exhumation of former Tamil Nadu chief minister J Jayalalithaa's body, Union minister M Venkaiah Naidu today said he was not in favour of it.

""I am not in favour of it personally. I hold her (Jayalalithaa) in high esteem. Exhuming the body somehow does not go down well with me,"" the Union Urban Development Minister said in reply to a question.

On December 29 last, while hearing a plea seeking a probe into the circumstances leading to Jayalalithaa's death, Justice S Vaidyanathan, who was heading a two-judge vacation bench, had said the public should know what had happened in this regard.

""After the demise, everybody has a right to question. I personally have a doubt,"" the judge had said while posting the matter to January 9 after issuing notices to the Centre and the state government.

Speaking to reporters at the BJP state headquarters here, Naidu said, ""If the judge has an opinion, it is his opinion. If he has issued notice, it will be replied to (by the Centre). Let us wait for what the court has to say.""

To a query on the treatment for Jayalalithaa, he said, ""We have no reasons not to believe the doctors. I too had enquired with them,"" adding that the former chief minister had recovered, but passed away due to a subsequent cardiac arrest.

On doubts over the treatment and circumstances leading up to Jayalalithaa's death, Naidu said, ""There will always be some doubting Thomases. Let them raise those doubts. They will be replied to at the appropriate forum by the authorities concerned and not by an individual Union minister.""

He asserted that even though there was an issue of privacy, the hospital had still come out with medical bulletins on the former chief minister's health condition.

""It is a matter of privacy, (still) bulletins were given and all precautions were taken. We should not raise such doubts unnecessarily without authentic information. If someone has authentic information, let them come out with it and then, the appropriate authorities will respond to it,"" Naidu said.

He also faced questions on the possibility of AIADMK chief VK Sasikala becoming the chief minister, whether the BJP was ""comfortable"" with Chief Minister O Panneerselvam and on ties between the Centre and the state following Jayalalithaa's death.

Naidu said the choice of who should helm the state was an internal matter of the ruling party over which neither the BJP nor the Centre had a say and nor would they interfere.

He added that the Centre conducted business with elected chief ministers of states, whoever they may be.

To a query on Lok Sabha Deputy Speaker M Thambidurai writing to Sasikala on his official letter pad requesting her to take charge as chief minister, Naidu said, ""He could have avoided the letter pad (to write a letter for a party matter)."""
"JAN 02 2017, 19:37 IST",National,"New Delhi, Jan 2, 2017, PTI,",Prepared for a two-front war but want peace: Army chief,"Army chief General Bipin Rawat today said his force is prepared for a two-front war involving Pakistan and China simultaneously but emphasised on the need to look at cooperation and not confrontation with Beijing.

His remarks came days after Beijing raised eyebrows over India testing 5000 km-range Agni 5 missile which has entire China within its reach.

""As far as armed forces are concerned, we are tasked to be prepared for a two-front war and I think we are capable of carrying out our task in whatever manner that we may be asked to do by the political hierarchy,"" Gen Rawat told NewsX channel.

General Rawat said as far as the northern border is concerned, army has adopted certain mechanism to ensure that a harmonious relationship is maintained along the Line of Actual Control.

He said that today four border personnel meetings took place at the LAC.

""This is to ensure that while we may be competing with each other for space, economic development, prosperity, there are also areas of cooperation. And I think that should be our focus area. Rather than looking at confrontation, we need to look at cooperation with China,"" he said.

Just before his retirement last month, Air Force Chief Air Chief Marshal Arup Raha, who was also the Chairman, Chief of Staff Committee, had said India was only building its deterrent capability.

Referring to large-scale modernisation activities along the borders with China, purchase of Rafale fighter aircraft, new vessels and submarines, Raha had said India is ""obviously building up"" capability not to actually fight a conflict as it believes in peace and tranquility.

In a candid admission in March last year, Raha had said that given the IAF's depleting strength, it does not have the adequate numbers to ""fully execute"" an air campaign in case of a two-front war involving Pakistan and China simultaneously."
"JAN 02 2017, 21:02 IST",National,"New Delhi/Lucknow, Jan 2, 2016, (PTI),",SP's war moves to Delhi; Mulayam approaches EC for symbol,"The war within the ruling Samajwadi Party of Uttar Pradesh today moved from Lucknow to Delhi where Mulayam Singh Yadav approached the Election Commission to stake claim over the 'cycle' symbol, hours after cancelling the January 5 party convention called by him.

Mulayam's son Akhilesh Yadav, the Chief Minister who deposed his father from the post of national party president, is likely to meet the full three-member Election Commission tomorrow with the same claim. In his absence, the rival camp could be represented by Ram Gopal Yadav.

The Election Commission sources said the poll body was unlikely to intervene till it hears the other side. Mulayam reached Nirvachan Sadan here this evening along with his brother Shivpal Singh, his close confidante Amar Singh and former MP Jaya Prada to put forth his stand on the feud which has virtually split the party he had founded 25 years ago.

""I am still the president of Samajwadi Party and the decision of the rival camp to appoint Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav as the party chief is against party's constitution,"" Mulayam told the full Election Commission.

Claiming to have the backing of the SP Parliamentary Baord, he said the party symbol 'cycle' belongs to him as he is the party president, sources said. Mulayam told the Commission that Ram Gopal Yadav, who had moved a resolution at emergency convention of SP in Lucknow on Friday last anointing Akhilesh as party president, had been expelled from the party and was not authorised to take any decision regarding SP, the sources said.

Mulayam said the convention of the rival camp, which passed a resolution to anoint Akhilesh as the new party chief, passed no resolution removing him (Mulayam) from the post.

He said as per the SP's constitution, such a decision needs the backing of the Parliamentary Board, which was absent. Sources in the Commission said it will follow Paragraph 15 of the Election Symbols (Reservation and Allotment) Order, 1968 to proceed on the dispute. It gives power to the Commission ""in relation to splinter groups or rival sections of a recognised political party"".

""Both the sides will have to stake claim over the symbol otherwise how would EC know that there is a dispute...we don't go by media reports,"" said an EC official. The Commission could ask both sides to pick a new party name and symbol in the interim if the existing symbol 'cycle' is frozen.

According to EC sources, if the elections are imminent, then the poll body does not have the time to verify the legislative majority of both factions. In that situation, it can pass an interim order asking both sides to pick a new party name and symbol.

This happened in the case of Uttarakhand Kranti Dal, a recognised state party in 2011. Both factions laid claim the symbol 'chair'.

The poll panel had then approved Uttarakhand Kranti Dal (P) with the symbol 'cup and saucer' for one group led by Trivender Singh Pawar and Jantantrik Uttarakhand Kranti Dal with the symbol 'kite' as the new name and symbol for the faction led by Diwakar Bhatt.

Earlier in the day, Mulayam asserted in Lucknow that ""Cycle symbol is ours.""

He asked party cadres to focus on winning the assembly elections likely to be announced any day now.

""No one can accuse me of wrongdoing. I have never indulged in corruption or betrayed anyone,"" he said.

He, however, postponed the SP convention which he had called in Luckonw on January 5.
In a series of tweets, SP leader Shivpal Yadav, the warring uncle of Akhilesh, maintained that Mulayam is the SP national president even now.

Shivpal gave no reasons for the abrupt postponement of the party convention, but insiders said perhaps the Mulayam camp was apprehensive of a poor turnout compared to the massive gathering at the ""convention"" held by Ram Gopal Yadav yesterday. The convention was declared illegal and unconstitutional by Mulayam.

The Samajwadi Party yesterday split down the middle with the faction headed by Chief Minister Akhilesh removing Mulayam as party chief and appointing him in his place at a convention in which the group claimed support of the majority of legislators and district units.

The two sides had engaged in mutual recriminatory expulsions with the convention called by Ram Gopal removing Akhilesh's warring uncle Shivpal as state party chief, and showing the door to ""outsider"" Amar Singh, who has been blamed for the feud in the Yadav clan.

Mulayam had retorted by again expelling his cousin Ram Gopal for six years along with national vice president Kiranmoy Nanda, who chaired the convention, and general secretary Naresh Agarwal for taking part in it.

Amar and Shivpal this morning reached Delhi to fine tune the strategy to ensure that the symbol remains with Mulayam ahead of assembly polls in the state. "
